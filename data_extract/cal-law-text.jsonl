Rule 10.60 amended effective February 1, 2018; adopted effective October 25, 2013.  Judicial Council Comment  Tribes are recognized as distinct, independent political nations (see Worcester v. Georgia  (1832) 31 U.S. 515, 559, and Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez  (1978) 436 U.S. 49, 55, citing Worcester ), which retain inherent authority to establish their own form of government, including tribal justice systems. (25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3601(4).) Tribal justice systems are an essential part of tribal governments and serve to ensure the public health and safety and the political integrity of tribal governments. (25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3601(5).) Traditional tribal justice practices are essential to the maintenance of the culture and identity of tribes. (25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3601(7).)  The constitutional recognition of tribes as sovereigns in a government-to-government relationship with all other sovereigns is a well-established principle of federal Indian law. (See Cohen\u2019s Handbook of Federal Indian Law  (2005) p. 207.) In recognition of this sovereignty, the council\u2019s oversight of the forum, through an internal committee under rule 10.30(d), is limited to oversight of the forum\u2019s work and activities and does not include oversight of any tribe or tribal court.

Government Code section 77009(h) provides that the \u201cJudicial Council or its representatives may perform audits, reviews, and investigations of superior court operations and records wherever they may be located.\u201d The Public Contract Code provides that the council shall publish a Judicial Branch Contracting Manual  (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 19206). It also provides that the California State  63 Auditor, subject to appropriations, shall biennially identify and audit five or more judicial branch entities to assess the implementation of the California Judicial Branch Contract Law (JBCL) (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 19210(a), (b)) and shall biennially conduct audits of Judicial Council staff to assess the implementation of, and compliance with, the JBCL (Pub.

(2) In-person comment   If security measures permit public attendance at an open in-person advisory body meeting, the meeting must include an opportunity for public comment on each agenda item before the advisory body considers the item. Requests to comment on an agenda item must be submitted before the meeting begins, \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": "represents, if any, and the agenda item that the public comment will address. The advisory body chair may grant a request to comment on an agenda item that is received after a meeting has begun.  (3) Reasonable limits and timing  The advisory body chair has discretion to establish reasonable limits on the  72 length of time for each speaker and the total amount of time permitted for public comment. The chair may also decide whether public comments will be heard at the beginning of the meeting or in advance of the agenda items.  (l) Making an audio recording of a meeting  An advisory body chair may permit a member of the public to make an audio recording of an open meeting, or the open portion of a meeting, if a written request is submitted at least two business days before the meeting.  (m) Minutes as official records  Minutes of each meeting subject to this rule, whether open or closed, must be prepared for approval at a future meeting. When approved by the advisory body, the minutes constitute the official record of the meeting. Approved minutes for the open portion of a meeting must be posted on the California Courts website.  (n) Adjourned meetings  An advisory body chair may adjourn a meeting to reconvene at a specified time without issuing a new notice under (e)(1), provided that, if open agenda items remain for discussion, notice of the adjourned meeting is posted on the California Courts website 24 hours before the meeting reconvenes. The notice must identify any remaining open agenda items to be discussed, the time that the meeting will reconvene, the telephone number that the public may use to attend the meeting, and if the public may attend the reconvened meeting in person, the location. The advisory body may not consider new agenda items when the meeting reconvenes except as permitted under (e)(2).  (o) Action by e-mail between meetings  An advisory body may take action by e-mail between meetings in circumstances specified in this subdivision.  (1) Circumstances   An advisory body chair may distribute a proposal by e-mail to all advisory body members for action between meetings if:  (A) The advisory body discussed and considered the proposal at a previous meeting but concluded additional information was needed; or  (B) The chair concludes that prompt action is needed.  (2) Notice   73 If an e-mail proposal concerns a matter that otherwise must be discussed in an open meeting, the advisory body must provide public notice and allow one complete business day for public comment concerning the proposal before acting on the proposal. The notice must be posted on the California Courts website and must provide an e-mail address to which the public may submit written comments. The advisory body may forego public comment if the chair concludes that prompt action is required.  (3) Communications   If an e-mail proposal concerns a matter that otherwise must be discussed in an open meeting, after distribution of the proposal and until the advisory body has acted, advisory body members must restrict their communications with each other about the proposal to e-mail. This restriction only applies to proposals distributed under this subdivision.  (4) Official record   Written minutes describing the action taken on an e-mail proposal that otherwise must be discussed in an open meeting must be prepared for approval at a future meeting. The minutes must attach any public comments received. When approved by the advisory body, the minutes constitute the official record of the proposal. Approved minutes for such a proposal must be posted to the California Courts website. The e-mails exchanged concerning a proposal that otherwise would have been considered in a closed meeting will constitute the official record of the proposal.  (p) Review requirement  The Judicial Council will review the impact of this rule within one year of the rule\u2019s adoption and periodically thereafter to determine whether amendments are needed. In conducting its review, the council will consider, among other factors, the public interest in access to meetings of the council\u2019s advisory bodies, the obligation of the judiciary to comply with judicial ethics standards, and the public interest in the ability of advisory bodies to effectively assist the Judicial Council by offering policy recommendations and alternatives for improving the administration of justice.  Rule 10.75 adopted effective July 1, 2014.  Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivisions (a) and (c)(1). This rule expands public access to Judicial Council advisory bodies. The council recognizes the important public interest in access to those meetings and to information regarding administration and governance of the judicial branch. Meetings of the Judicial Council are open, and notice and materials for those meetings are provided to the public, under rules 10.5 and 10.6. Rules in Division 1 of Title 10 describe the council\u2019s advisory bodies  74 and require that proposals for rules, standards, forms, and jury instructions be circulated for public comment. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rules 10.10\u201310.22, 10.30\u201310.70.) Reports to the council presenting proposals and recommendations are publicly posted on the California Courts website (www.courts.ca.gov ). Internal committee chairs report at each council meeting regarding the activities of the internal committees in the period since the last council meeting, and internal committee meeting minutes also are posted on the California Courts website. This rule expands on those existing rules and procedures to increase public access by opening the meetings of advisory bodies to review issues that the advisory body will report to the council. The rule does not apply to meetings that do not involve review of issues to be reported to the council, such as meetings providing education and training of members, discussion of best practices, or sharing of information of general interest unrelated to advice or reports to the council. Those non-advisory matters are outside the scope of this rule.  Subdivision (b)(1). The definition provided in (b)(1) is intended exclusively for this rule and includes internal committees, advisory committees, task forces, and other similar multimember bodies that the council creates to review issues and report to it. (Cf. Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.30(a) [\u201cJudicial Council advisory bodies are typically advisory committees and task forces].)  Subdivisions (c)(2), (c)(3), and (d)(10). The Code of Judicial Ethics governs the conduct of judges and is binding upon them. It establishes high standards of conduct that judges must personally observe, maintain, and enforce at all times to promote and protect public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. (See Code Judicial Ethics, Preamble, canon 1, canon 2A.) Among other things, compliance with these high ethical standards means avoiding conduct that could suggest a judge does not have an open mind in considering issues that may come before the judge. ( Id., canon 2A.) Judges also are prohibited from making public comments about a pending or impending proceeding ( id., canon 3B(9)), signifying that they may not publicly discuss case law that has not reached final disposition through the appellate process, or pending or anticipated litigation, conduct that would be required to participate in the work covered by the referenced subdivisions. Ethical standards also direct that they hear and decide all matters assigned to them, avoiding extrajudicial duties that would lead to their frequent disqualification. ( Id., canons 3B(1), 4A(4).)  The work of the three advisory bodies listed in subdivision (c)(2) exclusively involves discussion of topics that are uniquely difficult or impossible for judges to address while honoring the detailed ethical standards governing the judiciary. For example, as required by rule, the Litigation Management Committee discusses pending or anticipated claims and litigation against judicial officers, courts, and court employees. Jury instruction committees also may discuss decisions or rulings issued in cases that have not reached final resolution through the appellate process. Thus, opening the meetings of these three committees would result in precluding judges, who are specially learned in the law, from meaningful participation on those committees. Subdivision (c)(2) is added to avoid this result.  The work of the six rule committees listed in subdivision (c)(3) almost always will trigger similar issues. Those bodies focus primarily on developing, and providing input concerning, proposed legislation, rules, forms, and standards of judicial administration. That work necessarily entails a complex interchange of views, consideration of multiple perspectives, and the vetting of opposing legal arguments, which judges cannot undertake in public without risk that their comments will be misunderstood or used as a basis for disqualification or challenge. Service on the referenced committees, and public participation in discussing the referenced topics, may make it difficult for  75 a judge to hear and decide all matters assigned to the judge and conceivably could lead to frequent disqualification of the judge, exposing the judge to risk of an ethical violation. This may create significant practical issues for courts related to judicial workloads, while also deterring individuals specially learned in the law from serving on advisory bodies, in turn depriving the public of the benefits of their training and experience in crafting procedures for the effective and efficient administration of justice. Subdivisions (c)(3) and (d)(10) are intended to prevent such deleterious results by clarifying that meetings of the six rule committees whose work almost entirely focuses on these topics ordinarily will be closed and that meetings of other bodies performing similar functions also will be closed as the chairs deem appropriate, with the exception that any budget meetings must be open.  Subdivision (d)(7). Definitions of the terms \u201ctrade secret,\u201d \u201cprivileged information,\u201d and \u201cconfidential commercial and financial information,\u201d are provided in rule 10.500(f)(10).  Subdivision (k)(1). Due to budget constraints, members\u2019 schedules, and the geographic diversity of most committees\u2019 membership, advisory body meetings typically are held via teleconference or other method not requiring the members\u2019 in person attendance. Because judicial officer and attorney members may have limited time for meetings (e.g., only a lunch hour), the volume of advisory body business to be accomplished in those periods may be considerable, and the costs of coordinating teleconferences that would accommodate spoken comments from the public would be significant in the aggregate, the rule only provides for public comment in writing. To ensure sufficient time for advisory body staff to gather and distribute written comments to members, and for members to review comments before the meeting, the rule requires that comments be submitted one complete business day before the meeting.

(d) Responsibilities  In carrying out these duties, the Administrative Director is responsible for allocating the financial and other resources relating to the Judicial Council staff (including, for example, funding the operation of advisory bodies and other activities) to achieve the branch goals and policies adopted by the Judicial Council of California.  (Subd (d) amended effective July 29, 2014; adopted effective August 14, 2009.)  (e) Reports  The Administrative Director reports to the Judicial Council at least once annually on the progress made toward achieving the council\u2019s goals.

(b) References to \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts\u201d  The Judicial Council in the past referred to its staff as the \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts\u201d. The following applies where the term \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts\u201d is used:  (1) Rules of Court   Throughout these rules of court and in all Judicial Council forms, all references to \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts\u201d or \u201cAOC\u201d are deemed to refer to the Judicial Council, the Administrative Director, or the Judicial Council staff, as appropriate.   (2) Other Judicial Council materials and actions   All references to \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts\u201d or \u201cAOC\u201d in any policy, procedure, manual, guideline, publication, or other material issued by the Judicial Council or its staff are deemed to refer to the Judicial Council, the Administrative Director, or the Judicial Council staff, as appropriate. Judicial Council staff will continue to be responsible for any active delegations or directives the Judicial Council made to the Administrative Office of the Court.   (3) Statutes  The Judicial Council, its staff, or the Administrative Director, as appropriate, will continue to perform all functions, duties, responsibilities, and other obligations imposed by statute or regulation on the Administrative Office of the Courts.   (4) Agreements and proceedings   The Judicial Council will continue to perform all duties, responsibilities, functions, or other obligations, and bear all liabilities, and exercise all rights, powers, authorities, benefits, and other privileges attributed to the \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts\u201d or \u201cAOC\u201d arising from contracts, memorandums of understanding, or other legal agreements, documents, proceedings, or transactions. The Judicial Council may be substituted for the \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts\u201d or \u201cAOC\u201d wherever necessary, with no prejudice to the substantive rights of any party.

Advisory Committee Comment  The Judicial Council in 1961 adopted a resolution that named its staff the \u201cAdministrative Office of the California Courts.\u201d In 1970, the council adopted a rule of court that renamed its staff the \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts.\u201d  In recent years, the council became aware of recurring confusion about the relationship between the Administrative Office of the Courts and the Judicial Council. There was a common misperception that the Administrative Office of the Courts was a separate entity from the council having independent policymaking authority, when in fact, the members of the Judicial Council set policy, and staff, by whatever name, support the work of the council under the members\u2019 direction and oversight. The confusion about the role of the Administrative Office of the Courts impeded the council\u2019s ability to advance the interests of the judicial branch.   To allow the council to better achieve its mission, it decided in 2014 to retire the name \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts.\u201d This adjustment underscored the unity of identity of the Judicial Council and its staff, and clarified that there has always been only a single entity. The retirement conformed the Judicial Council\u2019s practice with that of other state government entities, which do not assign a separate name to their staffs.   The 2014 amendments to this rule are intended to implement the retirement of the name \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts\u201d and clarify that in retiring the name no substantive legal change has occurred. The Judicial Council and its staff will continue to discharge any legal obligations and duties they may have, regardless of the discontinuance of the use of the name \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts.\u201d   Division 2.

Judicial branch education  (a) Purpose  Judicial branch education for all justices, judges, subordinate judicial officers, and court personnel is essential to enhance the fair, effective, and efficient administration of justice. Participation in education activities is part of the official duties of judicial officers and court personnel. Judicial branch education is acknowledged as a vital component in achieving the goals of the Judicial Council\u2019s Long-Range Strategic Plan, which include access, fairness, and diversity; branch independence and accountability; modernization of management and administration; and quality of justice and service to the public. The responsibility for planning, conducting, and overseeing judicial branch education properly resides in the judicial branch.  (b) Education objectives  Justices, judges, subordinate judicial officers, court personnel, education committees, and others who plan and deliver education will endeavor to achieve the following objectives:  (1) To provide justices, judges, subordinate judicial officers, and court personnel with the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform their responsibilities competently, fairly, and efficiently;  (2) To ensure that education, including opportunities for orientation, continuing education, and professional development, is available to all justices, judges, subordinate judicial officers, and court personnel;  (3) To assist justices, judges, subordinate judicial officers, and court personnel in preserving the integrity and impartiality of the judicial system through their efforts to ensure that all members of the public have equal access to the  110 courts and equal ability to participate in court proceedings and are treated in a fair and just manner;  (4) To promote the adherence of justices, judges, subordinate judicial officers, and court personnel to the highest ideals of personal and official conduct, as set forth in the California Code of Judicial Ethics and the Code of Ethics for the Court Employees of California;  (5) To improve the administration of justice, reduce court delay, and promote fair and efficient management of court proceedings;  (6) To promote standardized court practices and procedures; and  (7) To implement the recommendations adopted by the Judicial Council in the California Standards of Judicial Administration.

Minimum education requirements, expectations, and recommendations  (a) Purpose  Justices, judges, and subordinate judicial officers are entrusted by the public with the impartial and knowledgeable handling of proceedings that affect the freedom, livelihood, and happiness of the people involved. Court personnel assist justices, judges, and subordinate judicial officers in carrying out their responsibilities and must provide accurate and timely services to the public. Justices, judges, subordinate judicial officers, and court staff members are individually responsible for maintaining and improving their professional competence. To assist them in enhancing their professional competence, the judicial branch will develop and maintain a comprehensive and high-quality education program, including minimum education requirements, expectations, and recommendations, to provide educational opportunities for all justices, judges, subordinate judicial officers, and court personnel.

Rule 10.492 amended effective January 1, 2022; adopted January 1, 2021.   150  Advisory Committee Comment  Various rules in title 10, chapter 7, of the California Rules of Court authorize, for good cause, the granting of an extension of time to complete content-based and hours-based education requirements and expectations. Nothing in this rule modifies that authority.  Nothing in this rule alters education requirements and expectations outside the California Rules of Court, including education requirements mandated by statute or regulation (e.g., Welf. & Inst. Code, \u00a7 304.7) or required by Judicial Council policy (e.g., the Qualifying Ethics Program and the Temporary Assigned Judges Program).  Subdivision (c). This subdivision applies to all rules of court containing content-based education requirements. Below are examples of this subdivision in practice.  Rule 10.462(c)(1) contains education requirements for new trial court judges and subordinate judicial officers. Based on the date on which individuals took their oath of office, rule 10.462(c)(1) allows judges six months within which to attend the New Judge Orientation (NJO) program, one year within which to attend an orientation course in their primary assignment, and two years within which to attend the B. E. Witkin Judicial College of California.  Under rule 10.462(c)(1), a judge who took the oath of office on January 1, 2020, is required to complete these programs by June 30, 2020 (NJO), December 31, 2020 (primary assignment orientation), and December 31, 2021 (judicial college), respectively. With the 12-month extension under rule 10.492(c)(1), this same judge now has to complete NJO by June 30, 2021, and a primary assignment orientation by, December 31, 2021. With the 30-month extension under rule 10.492(c)(2), the same judge must now complete the judicial college by June 30, 2024.  As another example of the extensions under rule 10.492(c), a judge who took the oath of office on December 1, 2018, needs to complete NJO by May 31, 2020 (within 18 months), a primary assignment orientation by November 30, 2020 (within two years), and the judicial college by May 31, 2023 (within 4.5 years).  Using a different rule as an example, rule 10.478(b)(1) requires court investigators to complete 18 hours of education on specified topics within 1 year of their start date. Rule 10.492(c) allows a court investigator up to 2 years to complete this education.  Subdivision (d). This subdivision applies to all rules of court containing hours-based education requirements. Below are examples of this subdivision in practice.  Rule 10.461(c)(1) contains education requirements for Supreme Court and Court of Appeal justices. Each justice must complete 30 hours of judicial education every three years.  Under rule 10.492(d), a justice\u2019s hours requirements are prorated for the three-year education cycle that runs from January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2021. For example, justices who were confirmed for appointment before January 1, 2019, must complete 20 hours of education by December 31, 2021.  Education hours requirements for justices who were confirmed for appointment on or after January 1, 2019, would be prorated by rule 10.492(d) and prorated additionally based on the number of years remaining in the three-year educational cycle. For example, a justice confirmed  151 for appointment on October 1, 2020, ordinarily has 10 hours of hours-based education to complete for the last year of the three-year cycle. Under rule 10.492(d), the months of January 2021 through March 2021 would be excluded, and the justice would have 7.5 hours rather than 10 hours of hours-based education to complete.  As an additional example, rule 10.474(c)(2) requires 8 hours of continuing education every two \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": "rule 10.492(d) prorates the number of hours of education required for the cycle that runs from January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2021. The number of hours required would be prorated for 4 quarters\u2014April 1, 2020, through March 31, 2021\u2014and would result in a reduced hours-based requirement of 4 hours.   Rule 10.493.  Instructor-led training  (a) Definition  \u201cInstructor-led training\u201d means synchronous education, guided by faculty, that allows for real-time communication between faculty and participants and is offered by an approved provider under rule 10.481. Examples of instructor-led training include in-person trainings in a classroom setting, live webinars, and live videoconferences.  (b) Application  Notwithstanding any other rule, instructor-led training may be used to satisfy all continuing education requirements specified in the California Rules of Court that require traditional (live, face-to-face) education. This provision applies whether the requirement relates to a specific course or to a certain percentage or number of hours of education.  Rule 10.493 adopted effective January 1, 20201.   Advisory Committee Comment  This rule is intended to eliminate within the California Rules of Court any restriction that requires that a specific course or a certain number or percentage of hours of education be taken in a traditional (live, face-to-face) learning environment. This rule applies whether the education is described as \u201ctraditional (live, face-to-face),\u201d \u201clive (face-to-face),\u201d \u201cin person,\u201d or any combination of these terms.

Smoking prohibited in all courts Rule 10.505.  Judicial robes  Rule 10.500.  Public access to judicial administrative records  (a) Intent  (1) The Judicial Council intends by this rule to implement Government Code section 68106.2(g), added by Senate Bill X4 13 (Stats. 2009-10, 4th Ex. Sess. ch. 22), which requires adoption of rules of court that provide public access to nondeliberative and nonadjudicative court records, budget and management information.   (2) This rule clarifies and expands the public\u2019s right of access to judicial administrative records and must be broadly construed to further the public\u2019s right of access.  (b) Application  (1) This rule applies to public access to judicial administrative records, including records of budget and management information relating to the administration of the courts.  (2) This rule does not apply to, modify or otherwise affect existing law regarding public access to adjudicative records.  (3) This rule does not restrict the rights to disclosure of information otherwise granted by law to a recognized employee organization.  (4) This rule does not affect the rights of litigants, including parties to administrative proceedings, under the laws of discovery of this state, nor does it limit or impair any rights of discovery in a criminal case.   (5) This rule does not apply to electronic mail and text messages sent or received before the effective date of this rule.  (c) Definitions  As used in this rule:  (1) \u201cAdjudicative record\u201d means any writing prepared for or filed or used in a court proceeding, the judicial deliberation process, or the assignment or reassignment of cases and of justices, judges (including temporary and  153 assigned judges), and subordinate judicial officers, or of counsel appointed or employed by the court.  (2) \u201cJudicial administrative record\u201d means any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the people\u2019s business that is prepared, owned, used, or retained by a judicial branch entity regardless of the writing\u2019s physical form or characteristics, except an adjudicative record. The term \u201cjudicial administrative record\u201d does not include records of a personal nature that are not used in or do not relate to the people\u2019s business, such as personal notes, memoranda, electronic mail, calendar entries, and records of Internet use.   (3) \u201cJudicial branch entity\u201d means the Supreme Court, each Court of Appeal, each superior court, and the Judicial Council.   (4) \u201cJudicial branch personnel\u201d means justices, judges (including temporary and assigned judges), subordinate judicial officers, members of the Judicial Council and its advisory bodies, and directors, officers, employees, volunteers, and agents of a judicial branch entity.   (5) \u201cPerson\u201d means any natural person, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, firm, or association.  (6) \u201cWriting\u201d means any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photographing, photocopying, electronic mail, fax, and every other means of recording on any tangible thing any form of communication or representation, including letters, words, pictures, sounds, symbols, or combinations, regardless of the manner in which the record has been stored.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2016.)  (d) Construction of rule  (1) Unless otherwise indicated, the terms used in this rule have the same meaning as under the Legislative Open Records Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 9070 et seq.) and the California Public Records Act ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 6250 et seq.) and must be interpreted consistently with the interpretation applied to the terms under those acts.   (2) This rule does not require the disclosure of a record if the record is exempt from disclosure under this rule or is the type of record that would not be subject to disclosure under the Legislative Open Records Act or the California Public Records Act.  (e) Public access  (1) Access   154 (A) A judicial branch entity must allow inspection and copying of judicial administrative records unless the records are exempt from disclosure under this rule or by law.   (B) Nothing in this rule requires a judicial branch entity to create any record or to compile or assemble data in response to a request for judicial administrative records if the judicial branch entity does not compile or assemble the data in the requested form for its own use or for provision to other agencies. For purposes of this rule, selecting data from extractable fields in a single database using software already owned or licensed by the judicial branch entity does not constitute creating a record or compiling or assembling data.  (C) If a judicial administrative record contains information that is exempt from disclosure and the exempt portions are reasonably segregable, a judicial branch entity must allow inspection and copying of the record after deletion of the portions that are exempt from disclosure. A judicial branch entity is not required to allow inspection or copying of the portion of a writing that is a judicial administrative record unless that portion is reasonably segregable from the portion that constitutes an adjudicative record.  (D) If requested, a superior court must provide a copy of the certified judicial administrative record if the judicial administrative record requested has previously been certified by the superior court.   (2) Examples   Judicial administrative records subject to inspection and copying unless exempt from disclosure under subdivision (f) include, but are not limited to, the following:  (A) Budget information submitted to the Judicial Council after enactment of the annual Budget Act;  (B) Any other budget and expenditure document pertaining to the administrative operation of the courts, including quarterly financial statements and statements of revenue, expenditure, and reserves;  (C) Actual and budgeted employee salary and benefit information;   (D) Copies of executed contracts with outside vendors and payment information and policies concerning goods and services provided by outside vendors without an executed contract;   (E) Final audit reports; and  155  (F) Employment contracts between judicial branch entities and their employees.  (3) Procedure for requesting records   A judicial branch entity must make available on its public Web site or otherwise publicize the procedure to be followed to request a copy of or to inspect a judicial administrative record. At a minimum, the procedure must include the address to which requests are to be addressed, to whom requests are to be directed, and the office hours of the judicial branch entity.  (4) Costs of duplication, search, and review    (A) A judicial branch entity, on request, must provide a copy of a judicial administrative record not exempt from disclosure if the record is of a nature permitting copying, subject to payment of the fee specified in this rule or other applicable statutory fee. A judicial branch entity may require advance payment of any fee.  (B) A judicial branch entity may impose on all requests a fee reasonably calculated to cover the judicial branch entity\u2019s direct costs of duplication of a record or of production of a record in an electronic format under subdivision (i). The fee includes:  (i) A charge per page, per copy, or otherwise, as established and published by the Judicial Council, or as established by the judicial branch entity following a notice and comment procedure specified by the Judicial Council, representing the direct costs of equipment, supplies, and staff time required to duplicate or produce the requested record; and  (ii) Any other direct costs of duplication or production, including, but not limited to, the costs incurred by a judicial branch entity in retrieving the record from a remote storage facility or archive and the costs of mailing responsive records.  (C) In the case of requests for records for commercial use, a judicial branch entity may impose, in addition to the fee in (B), a fee reasonably calculated to cover the actual costs of staff search and review time, based on an hourly rate for salary and benefits of each employee involved.  (D) For purposes of this rule:    156 (i) \u201cCommercial use\u201d means a request for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is being made. A request from a representative of the news media that supports its news-dissemination function is not a request for a commercial use.  (ii) \u201cRepresentative of the news media\u201d means a person who regularly gathers, prepares, collects, photographs, records, writes, edits, reports, or publishes news or information that concerns local, national, or international events or other matters of public interest for dissemination to the public for a substantial portion of the person's livelihood or for substantial financial gain.  (iii) \u201cSearch and review time\u201d means actual time spent identifying and locating judicial administrative records, including material within documents, responsive to a request; determining whether any portions are exempt from disclosure; and performing all tasks necessary to prepare the records for disclosure, including redacting portions exempt from disclosure. \u201cSearch and review time\u201d does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the applicability of particular exemptions.  (E) By January 1, 2012, the Judicial Council will review and evaluate the numbers of requests received, the time necessary to respond, and the fees imposed by judicial branch entities for access to records and information. The Judicial Council\u2019s review will consider the impact of this rule on both the public\u2019s access to records and information and on judicial branch entities\u2019 ability to carry out and fund core judicial operations.  (5) Inspection   A judicial branch entity must make judicial administrative records in its \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": "during the office hours of the judicial branch entity provided that the record is of a nature permitting inspection.  (6) Time for determination of disclosable records   A judicial branch entity, on a request that reasonably describes an identifiable record or records, must determine, within 10 calendar days from receipt of the request, whether the request, in whole or in part, seeks disclosable judicial administrative records in its possession and must promptly notify the requesting party of the determination and the reasons for the determination.   157 (7) Response   If a judicial branch entity determines that a request seeks disclosable judicial administrative records, the judicial branch entity must make the disclosable judicial administrative records available promptly. The judicial branch entity must include with the notice of the determination the estimated date and time when the records will be made available. If the judicial branch entity determines that the request, in whole or in part, seeks nondisclosable judicial administrative records, it must convey its determination in writing, include a contact name and telephone number to which inquiries may be directed, and state the express provision of this rule justifying the withholding of the records not disclosed.   (8) Extension of time for determination of disclosable records   In unusual circumstances, to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request, a judicial branch entity may extend the time limit prescribed for its determination under (e)(6) by no more than 14 calendar days by written notice to the requesting party, stating the reasons for the extension and the date on which the judicial branch entity expects to make a determination. As used in this section, \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d means the following:  (A) The need to search for and collect the requested records from multiple locations or facilities that are separate from the office processing the request;  (B) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of records that are included in a single request; or   (C) The need for consultation, which must be conducted with all practicable speed, with another judicial branch entity or other governmental agency having substantial subject matter interest in the determination of the request, or with two or more components of the judicial branch entity having substantial subject matter interest in the determination of the request.  (9) Reasonable efforts   (A) On receipt of a request to inspect or obtain a copy of a judicial administrative record, a judicial branch entity, in order to assist the requester in making a focused and effective request that reasonably describes an identifiable judicial administrative record, must do all of the following to the extent reasonable under the circumstances:   158 (i) Assist the requester in identifying records and information responsive to the request or to the purpose of the request, if stated;   (ii) Describe the information technology and physical location in which the records exist; and  (iii) Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying inspection or copying of the records or information sought.  (B) The requirements of (A) will be deemed to have been satisfied if the judicial branch entity is unable to identify the requested information after making a reasonable effort to elicit additional clarifying information from the requester that helps identify the record or records.  (C) The requirements of (A) do not apply to a request for judicial administrative records if the judicial branch entity makes the requested records available or determines that the requested records are exempt from disclosure under this rule.  (10) No obstruction or delay   Nothing in this rule may be construed to permit a judicial branch entity to delay or obstruct the inspection or copying of judicial administrative records that are not exempt from disclosure.   (11) Greater access permitted   Except as otherwise prohibited by law, a judicial branch entity may adopt requirements for itself that allow for faster, more efficient, or greater access to judicial administrative records than prescribed by the requirements of this rule.  (12) Control of records   A judicial branch entity must not sell, exchange, furnish, or otherwise provide a judicial administrative record subject to disclosure under this rule to a private entity in a manner that prevents a judicial branch entity from providing the record directly under this rule. A judicial branch entity must not allow a private entity to control the disclosure of information that is otherwise subject to disclosure under this rule.  (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2016.)   159 (f) Exemptions  Nothing in this rule requires the disclosure of judicial administrative records that are any of the following:  (1) Preliminary writings, including drafts, notes, working papers, and inter-judicial branch entity or intra-judicial branch entity memoranda, that are not retained by the judicial branch entity in the ordinary course of business, if the public interest in withholding those records clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure;  (2) Records pertaining to pending or anticipated claims or litigation to which a judicial branch entity is a party or judicial branch personnel are parties, until the pending litigation or claim has been finally adjudicated or otherwise resolved;  (3) Personnel, medical, or similar files, or other personal information whose disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, including, but not limited to, records revealing home addresses, home telephone numbers, cellular telephone numbers, private electronic mail addresses, and social security numbers of judicial branch personnel and work electronic mail addresses and work telephone numbers of justices, judges (including temporary and assigned judges), subordinate judicial officers, and their staff attorneys;  (4) Test questions, scoring keys, and other examination data used to develop, administer, and score examinations for employment, certification, or qualification;  (5) Records whose disclosure is exempted or prohibited under state or federal law, including provisions of the California Evidence Code relating to privilege, or by court order in any court proceeding;  (6) Records whose disclosure would compromise the security of a judicial branch entity or the safety of judicial branch personnel, including but not limited to, court security plans, and security surveys, investigations, procedures, and assessments;  (7) Records related to evaluations of, complaints regarding, or investigations of justices, judges (including temporary and assigned judges), subordinate judicial officers, and applicants or candidates for judicial office;   (8) The contents of real estate appraisals or engineering or feasibility estimates and evaluations made for or by the judicial branch entity related to the acquisition of property or to prospective public supply and construction contracts, until all of the property has been acquired or the relevant contracts  160 have been executed. This provision does not affect the law of eminent domain;   (9) Records related to activities governed by Government Code sections 71600 et seq. and 71800 et seq. that reveal deliberative processes, impressions, evaluations, opinions, recommendations, meeting minutes, research, work products, theories, or strategy or that provide instruction, advice, or training to employees who are not represented by employee organizations under those sections. Nothing in this subdivision limits the disclosure duties of a judicial branch entity with respect to any other records relating to the activities governed by the employee relations acts referred to in this subdivision;   (10) Records that contain trade secrets or privileged or confidential commercial and financial information submitted in response to a judicial branch entity\u2019s solicitation for goods or services or in the course of a judicial branch entity\u2019s contractual relationship with a commercial entity. For purposes of this rule:   (A) \u201cTrade secret\u201d means information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that:  (i) Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and  (ii) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy;  (B) \u201cPrivileged information\u201d means material that falls within recognized constitutional, statutory, or common law privileges;  (C) \u201cConfidential commercial and financial information\u201d means information whose disclosure would:  (i) Impair the judicial branch entity\u2019s ability to obtain necessary information in the future; or  (ii) Cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained.  (11) Records whose disclosure would disclose the judicial branch entity\u2019s or judicial branch personnel\u2019s decision-making process, provided that, on the facts of the specific request for records, the public interest served by nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record; or   161 (12) If, on the facts of the specific request for records, the public interest served by nondisclosure of the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record.  (g) Computer software; copyrighted materials  (1) Computer software developed by a judicial branch entity or used by a judicial branch entity for the storage or manipulation of data is not a judicial administrative record under this rule. For purposes of this rule \u201ccomputer software\u201d includes computer mapping systems, computer graphic systems, and computer programs, including the source, object, and other code in a computer program.  (2) This rule does not limit a judicial branch entity\u2019s ability to sell, lease, or license computer software for commercial or noncommercial use.  (3) This rule does not create an implied warranty on the part of any judicial branch entity for errors, omissions, or other defects in any computer software.   (4) This rule does not limit any copyright protection. A judicial branch entity is not required to duplicate records under this rule in violation of any copyright.  (5) Nothing in this subdivision is intended to affect the judicial administrative record status of information merely because the information is stored in a computer. Judicial administrative records stored in a computer will be disclosed as required in this rule.  (h) Waiver of exemptions  (1) Disclosure of a judicial administrative record that is exempt from disclosure under this rule or provision of law by a judicial branch entity or judicial branch personnel acting within the scope of their office or employment constitutes a waiver of the exemptions applicable to that particular record.   (2) This subdivision does not apply to disclosures:  (A) Made through discovery proceedings;  (B) Made through other legal proceedings or as otherwise required by law;  (C) Made to another judicial branch entity or judicial branch personnel for the purposes of judicial branch administration;  (D) Within the scope of a statute that limits disclosure of specified writings to certain purposes; or   162 (E) Made to any governmental agency or to another judicial branch entity or judicial branch personnel if the material will be treated confidentially.  (i) Availability in electronic format   (1) A judicial branch entity that has information that constitutes an identifiable judicial administrative record not exempt from disclosure under this rule and that is in an electronic format must, on request, produce that information in the electronic format requested, provided that:  (A) No law prohibits disclosure;  (B) The record already exists in the requested electronic format, or the judicial branch entity has previously produced the judicial \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": "provision to other agencies;   (C) The requested electronic format is customary or standard for records of a similar type and is commercially available to private entity requesters; and   (D) The disclosure does not jeopardize or compromise the security or integrity of the original record or the computer software on which the original record is maintained.  (2) In addition to other fees imposed under this rule, the requester will bear the direct cost of producing a record if:  (A) In order to comply with (1), the judicial branch entity would be required to produce a record and the record is one that is produced only at otherwise regularly scheduled intervals or;  (B) Producing the requested record would require data compilation or extraction or any associated programming that the judicial branch entity is not required to perform under this rule but has agreed to perform in response to the request.   (3) Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to require a judicial branch entity to reconstruct a record in an electronic format if the judicial branch entity no longer has the record available in an electronic format.  (j) Public access disputes  (1) Unless the petitioner elects to proceed under (2) below, disputes and appeals of decisions with respect to disputes with the Judicial Council or a superior  163 court regarding access to budget and management information required to be maintained under rule 10.501 are subject to the process described in rule 10.803.  (2) Any person may institute proceedings for injunctive or declarative relief or writ of mandate in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce his or her right to inspect or to receive a copy of any judicial administrative record under this rule.   (3) Whenever it is made to appear by verified petition that a judicial administrative record is being improperly withheld from disclosure, the court with jurisdiction will order the judicial branch entity to disclose the records or show cause why it should not do so. The court will decide the case after examining the record (in camera if appropriate), papers filed by the parties, and any oral argument and additional evidence as the court may allow.  (4) If the court finds that the judicial branch entity\u2019s decision to refuse disclosure is not justified under this rule, the court will order the judicial branch entity to make the record public. If the court finds that the judicial branch entity\u2019s decision was justified, the court will issue an order supporting the decision.  (5) An order of the court, either directing disclosure or supporting the decision of the judicial branch entity refusing disclosure, is not a final judgment or order within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1 from which an appeal may be taken, but will be immediately reviewable by petition to the appellate court for the issuance of an extraordinary writ. Upon entry of an order under this subdivision, a party must, in order to obtain review of the order, file a petition within 20 days after service of a written notice of entry of the order or within such further time not exceeding an additional 20 days as the court may for good cause allow. If the notice is served by mail, the period within which to file the petition will be extended by 5 days. A stay of an order or judgment will not be granted unless the petitioning party demonstrates it will otherwise sustain irreparable damage and probable success on the merits. Any person who fails to obey the order of the court will be cited to show cause why that is not in contempt of court.  (6) The court will award court costs and reasonable attorney fees to the plaintiff should the plaintiff prevail in litigation filed under this subdivision. The costs and fees will be paid by the judicial branch entity and will not become a personal liability of any individual. If the court finds that the plaintiff\u2019s case is clearly frivolous, it will award court costs and reasonable attorney fees to the judicial branch entity.  (Subd (j) amended effective January 1, 2016.)  Rule 10.500 amended effective January 1, 2016; adopted effective January 1, 2010.   164 Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivision (a).  By establishing a public access rule applicable to all judicial administrative records, the proposed rule would expand public access to these records. The Judicial Council recognizes the important public interest in access to records and information relating to the administration of the judicial branch. The Judicial Council also recognizes the importance of the privacy rights of individuals working in or doing business with judicial branch entities and the public\u2019s interest in an effective and independent judicial branch of state government. The report on this rule includes the Judicial Council\u2019s findings on the impact of this rule on these interests, and how these interests are protected by the rule.   Subdivisions (b)(1) and (b)(2).  This rule does not apply to adjudicative records, and is not intended to modify existing law regarding public access to adjudicative records. California case law has established that, in general, subject to specific statutory exceptions, case records that accurately and officially reflect the work of the court are public records open to inspection. (Estate of Hearst (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 777, 782-83. ) However, documents prepared in the course of adjudicative work and not regarded as official case records, such as preliminary drafts, personal notes, and rough records of proceedings, are not subject to public access because the perceived harm to the judicial process by requiring this material to be available to the public is greater than the benefit the public might derive from its disclosure. ( Copley Press, Inc. v. Superior Court (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 106.)   Subdivision (c)(2).  The application of this rule is intended to reflect existing case law under the California Public Records Act that exempts from the definition of \u201cpublic record\u201d certain types of personal records and information. The concept was first discussed in the California Assembly and establishes that if personal correspondence and information are \u201cunrelated to the conduct of the people\u2019s business\u201d they are therefore not public records. ( San Gabriel Tribune v. Superior Court (1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 762, 774, citing Assembly Committee on Statewide Information Policy California Public Records Act of 1968, section B, page 9, Appendix to Assembly Journal (1970 Reg. Sess.).) Case law has further established that only records necessary or convenient to the discharge of official duty, or kept as necessary or convenient to the discharge of official duty, are public records for the purposes of the California Public Records Act and its predecessors. ( Braun v. City of Taft (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 332 ; City Council of Santa Monica v. Superior Court  (1962) 204 Cal.App.2d 68.)  Subdivision (e)(4).  The fees charged by a judicial branch entity under this rule are intended to allow the entity to recover an amount not to exceed the reasonable costs of responding to a request for records or information. In accordance with existing practice within the judicial branch and the other branches of government, the Judicial Council intends agencies and entities of the executive and legislative branches of the California state government to receive records or information requested from judicial branch entities for the agency\u2019s or entity\u2019s use free of charge. This subdivision is intended to provide, however, that requesters of records or information for the purpose of furthering the requester\u2019s commercial interests will be charged for costs incurred by the judicial branch entity in responding to the request, and that such costs will not be a charge against the budget of the judicial branch of the state General Fund.   Subdivision (f)(3).  In addition to the types of records and information exempt from disclosure under the corresponding provision of the California Public Records Act, Government Code section 6254(c), this provision includes a further nonexclusive list of specific information that is exempt under this rule. The rule does not attempt to list each category of information that is  165 specific to judicial branch entities and that may also be exempt under this rule. For example, although they are not specifically listed, this provision exempts from disclosure records maintained by any court or court-appointed counsel administrator for the purpose of evaluating attorneys seeking or being considered for appointment to cases.  Subdivision (f)(10).  The definition of \u201ctrade secret\u201d restates the definition in Civil Code section 3426.1.   Subdivision (f)(11). This subdivision is intended to reflect California law on the subject of the \u201cdeliberative process\u201d exemption under the California Public Records Act, which is currently stated in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court  (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325 and the later Court of Appeal decisions California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 159 and Wilson v. Superior Court  (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 1136.  Subdivision (j)(1). Under current rule 10.803 a petitioner may file a writ in a superior court regarding a dispute with a superior court or the Judicial Council with respect to disclosure of records and information required to be maintained under current rule 10.802. The writ petition must be heard on an expedited basis and includes a right to an appeal. The statutory authority for the hearing process set forth in current rule 10.803, Government Code section 71675(b), does not extend this procedure to other disputes with respect to public access. The rule provides that petitioners with a dispute with any other judicial branch entity, or with respect to records that are not required to be maintained under rule 10.802, may follow the procedure set forth in (j)(2) through (j)(6), which is equivalent to the dispute resolution procedure of the California Public Records Act. A petitioner eligible for the dispute resolution process set out in current rule 10.803 may also elect to proceed with his or her dispute under the procedure set forth in (j)(2) through (j)(6).   Rule 10.501.  Maintenance of budget and management information  (a) Maintenance of information by the superior court   Each superior court must maintain for a period of three years from the close of the fiscal year to which the following relate:   (1) Official documents of the superior court pertaining to the approved superior court budget allocation adopted by the Judicial Council and actual final year-end superior court revenue and expenditure reports as required in budget procedures issued by Judicial Council staff to be maintained or reported to the council, including budget allocation, revenue, and expenditure reports;  (2) Records or other factual management information on matters that are within the scope of representation as defined in Government Code section 71634 unless distribution is otherwise precluded by law; and  (3) Records or other factual management information on other matters referred to in Government Code section 71634 unless distribution is otherwise precluded by law.   166 (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2016.)

Advisory Committee Comment  The internal local rule described in this rule relates only to the internal management of the court, and as such is exempt from the requirements in rule 10.613. (See rule 10.613(j).)   Rule 10.603.  Authority and duties of presiding judge  (a) General responsibilities  The presiding judge is responsible, with the assistance of the court executive officer, for leading the court, establishing policies, and allocating resources in a manner that promotes access to justice for all members of the public, provides a forum for the fair and expeditious resolution of disputes, maximizes the use of judicial and other resources, increases efficiency in court operations, and enhances service to the public.

(2) No local rule or policy may limit the authority of the presiding judge as granted in the rules of court.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (c) Duties  (1) Assignments   The presiding judge has ultimate authority to make judicial assignments. The presiding judge must:  (A) Designate a judge to preside in each department, including a master calendar judge when appropriate, and designate a presiding judge of the juvenile division and a supervising judge for each division, district, or branch court. In making judicial assignments, the presiding judge must take into account the following:   (i) The needs of the public and the court, as they relate to the efficient and effective management of the court\u2019s calendar;  (ii) The knowledge and abilities demanded by the assignment;  (iii) The judge\u2019s judicial and nonjudicial experience, including specialized training or education;  (iv) The judge\u2019s interests;  (v) The need for continuity in the assignment;  (vi) The desirability of exposing the judge to a particular type of assignment; and  175  (vii) Other appropriate factors. Judicial assignments must not be based solely or primarily on seniority;  (B) Assign to a master calendar judge any of the duties that may more appropriately be performed by that department;  (C) Supervise the court\u2019s calendar, apportion the business of the court among the several departments of the court as equally as possible, and publish for general distribution copies of a current calendar specifying the judicial assignments of the judges and the times and places assigned for hearings;  (D) Reassign cases between departments as convenience or necessity requires; and  (E) Designate a judge to act if by law or the rules of court a matter is required to be presented to or heard by a particular judge and that judge is absent, deceased, or unable to act.

A court may, by local rule, establish a lower maximum number of such days. This paragraph applies only to vacation days accrued after January 1, 2001. It does not affect any unused vacation days that a judge may have accrued before January 1, 2001, which are governed by local court policy, nor does it create any right to compensation for unused vacation days.  (H) The court must, by local rule, define a day of vacation. Absence from court to attend an authorized education program, conference, or workshop for judges, or to participate in Judicial Council or other authorized committees or community outreach activities, is not vacation time if attendance is in accordance with the plan and has the prior approval of the presiding judge. Absence from court due to illness is not vacation time. This rule does not limit the time a judge may be absent from court when unable to work because of illness.

(5) Personnel   (A) The presiding judge must provide general direction to and supervision of the court executive officer, or, if the court has no executive officer, perform the duties of the court executive regarding personnel as specified in rule 10.610(c)(1).  179  (B) The presiding judge must approve, in writing, the total compensation package (salary and all benefits) offered to the court executive officer \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}

Notification to State Bar of attorney misconduct  (a) Notification by judge  When notification to the State Bar is required under Business and Professions Code section 6086.7, the judge issuing the order that triggers the notification requirement under section 6086.7 is responsible for notifying the State Bar. The judge may direct court staff to notify the State Bar.  (b) Contents of notice  The notice must include the State Bar member\u2019s full name and State Bar number, if known, and a copy of the order that triggered the notification requirement.    (c) Notification to attorney  If notification to the State Bar is made under this rule, the person who notified the State Bar must also inform the attorney who is the subject of the notification that the matter has been referred to the State Bar.  Rule 10.609 adopted effective January 1, 2014.  Advisory Committee Comment  Business and Professions Code section 6086.7 requires a court to notify the State Bar of any of the following: (1) a final order of contempt imposed on an attorney that may involve grounds warranting discipline under the State Bar Act; (2) a modification or reversal of a judgment in a judicial proceeding based in whole or in part on the misconduct, incompetent representation, or willful misrepresentation of an attorney; (3) the imposition of any judicial sanctions on an attorney of $1,000 or more, except sanctions for failure to make discovery; or (4) the imposition of any civil penalty on an attorney under Family Code section 8620. If the notification pertains to a final order of contempt, Business and Professions Code section 6086.7(a)(1) requires the court to transmit to the State Bar a copy of the relevant minutes, final order, and transcript, if one  183 exists. This rule is intended to clarify who has the responsibility of notifying the State Bar under section 6086.7 and the required contents of the notice.  In addition to the requirements stated in Business and Professions Code section 6086.7, judges are subject to canon 3D(2) of the California Code of Judicial Ethics, which states: \u201cWhenever a judge has personal knowledge, or concludes in a judicial decision, that a lawyer has committed misconduct or has violated any provision of the Rules of Professional Conduct, the judge shall take appropriate corrective action, which may include reporting the violation to the appropriate authority.\u201d The Advisory Committee Commentary states: \u201cAppropriate corrective action could include direct communication with the judge or lawyer who has committed the violation, other direct action, such as a confidential referral to a judicial or lawyer assistance program, or a report of the violation to the presiding judge, appropriate authority, or other agency or body. Judges should note that in addition to the action required by Canon 3D(2), California law imposes mandatory additional reporting requirements on judges regarding lawyer misconduct.

Rule 10.625 adopted effective January 1, 2007.  197  Advisory Committee Comment  This rule is intended to facilitate the courts\u2019 continued efforts to achieve the goals stated in standard 10.50 [formerly section 17] of the Standards of Judicial Administration, which encourages courts to employ various methods of soliciting prospective candidates to serve on regular grand juries that reflect a representative cross-section of the community they serve. Those methods include obtaining recommendations for grand jurors who encompass a cross-section of the county\u2019s population base, solicited from a broad representation of community-based organizations, civic leaders, and superior court judges, referees, and commissioners subdivision (b)(2)); having the court consider carry-over grand jury selections under Penal Code section 901(b) to ensure broad-based representation (Subd (c)); and encouraging judges who nominate persons for grand jury service under Penal Code section 903.4 to select candidates from the list returned by the jury commissioner or otherwise employing a nomination procedure to ensure broad-based representation from the community.

Rule 10.740 amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007; adopted as rule 6.740 effective July 1, 2006.  Rule 10.741.   Duties and authority of the presiding judge  (a) General duties  The presiding judge is responsible for the recruitment, selection, training, appointment, supervision, assignment, performance, and evaluation of court-appointed temporary judges. In carrying out these responsibilities, the presiding judge is assisted by the Temporary Judge Administrator as provided in rule 10.743.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Publicizing the opportunity to serve as a temporary judge   217 (1) Except for those courts that have nine or fewer authorized judge positions or use only research attorneys as temporary judges, each trial court that uses court-appointed temporary judges must publicize the opportunity to serve as a temporary judge whenever the court seeks to add attorneys to its pool of temporary judges or within a reasonable time before conducting its mandatory training for temporary judges but, in any case, no less than once every three years.  (2) Courts must publicize this opportunity in a manner that maximizes the potential for a diverse applicant pool, which includes publicizing the opportunity to legal communities and organizations, including all local bar associations, in their geographical area. This publicity should encourage and must provide an equal opportunity for all eligible individuals to seek positions as court-appointed temporary judges and not exclude individuals based on their gender, race, ethnicity, disability, religion, sexual orientation, age, or other protected class.  (Subd (b) adopted effective July 1, 2012.)  (c) Nondiscrimination in application and selection procedure  Each trial court that uses court-appointed temporary judges must conduct an application and selection procedure for temporary judges that ensures the most qualified applicants for appointment are selected and must not reject applicants who otherwise meet the requirements for appointment based on their gender, race, ethnicity, disability, religion, sexual orientation, age, or other protected class. Among the qualifications to be considered in the selection procedure are the applicant\u2019s exposure to and experience with diverse populations and issues related to those populations.  (Subd (c) adopted effective July 1, 2012.)  (d) Authority to remove or discontinue  The presiding judge has the discretion to remove a court-appointed temporary judge or to discontinue using an attorney as a court-appointed temporary judge at any time.

Rule 10.741 amended effective July 1, 2012; adopted as rule 6.741 effective July 1, 2006; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007.  Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivision (b). This subdivision is intended to offer all attorneys who satisfy the requirements for appointment under rule 2.812 the opportunity to serve as temporary judges and to expand the  218 size and diversity of the pool of eligible candidates. Pursuant to the rule, courts that do not use temporary judges, that have nine or fewer authorized and funded judge positions, or that only use their research attorneys as temporary judges are exempt from the requirement to publicize the opportunity to serve as a temporary judge. Courts that use temporary judges may publicize the opportunity in a manner they determine to be most effective, given their individual circumstances. In attempting to broaden the diversity of the temporary judge applicant pool, courts also have the flexibility to widen the geographical areas in which they publicize the opportunity. Thus, courts are not limited to publicizing their temporary judge program through the local or state bar associations. However, they must include all local bar associations when they do so. Further, the method of publication is purposefully left to the court\u2019s discretion. No-cost methods exist, such as email, use of the court\u2019s public website, and oral announcements at local bar association or legal organization events. Publicizing this opportunity no less than once every three years should increase the potential for greater diversity among the temporary judges who serve the courts.  Subdivision (c).  This subdivision emphasizes that the selection and appointment process must be devoid of discrimination. These provisions are intended to discourage favoritism in the appointment process and permit the courts to consider, as an additional qualification, an attorney\u2019s exposure to and experience with the diverse populations and issues unique to that population in the county where they are seeking appointment. \u201cExposure to and experience with diverse populations\u201d includes work, social interaction, educational experiences, or community involvement with individuals or groups from diverse communities that may appear in court.  Rule 10.742.  Use of attorneys as court-appointed temporary judges  (a) Responsibility of the presiding judge  The presiding judge of the trial court is responsible for determining whether that court needs to use attorneys as temporary judges and, if so, the specific purposes for which attorneys are to be appointed as temporary judges.  (b) Conditions for the use of court-appointed temporary judges  The presiding judge may appoint an attorney as a court-appointed temporary judge only if all the following circumstances apply:  (1) The appointment of an attorney to serve as a temporary judge is necessary to fill a judicial need in that court;  (2) The attorney serving as a temporary judge has been approved by the court where the attorney will serve under rule 2.810 et seq.;  (3) The appointment of the attorney as a temporary judge does not result in any conflict of interest; and  (4) There is no appearance of impropriety resulting from the appointment of the attorney to serve as a temporary judge.   219 (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)

{"prompt": "amended effective January 1, 2016.  Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivisions (a)\u2013(b).  These subdivisions provide that the presiding judge in each court is responsible for determining whether court-appointed temporary judges need to be used in that court, and these subdivisions furnish the criteria for determining when their use is proper.  Under (b)(1), the use and appointment of court-appointed temporary judges must be based on judicial needs.  Under (b)(3), an attorney serving as a temporary judge would have a conflict of interest if the disqualifying factors in the Code of Judicial Ethics exist. Under (b)(4), the test for the appearance of impropriety is whether a person aware of the facts might entertain a doubt that the judge would be able to act with integrity, impartiality, and competence.  In addition to the disqualifying factors listed in the Code of Judicial Ethics, an appearance of impropriety would be generated if any of the limitations in family law, unlawful detainer, and other cases identified in the Code of Judicial Ethics are present.   Rule 10.743.  Administrator of temporary judges program  (a) Administrator  The presiding judge who appoints attorneys as temporary judges must designate a clerk, executive officer, or other court employee knowledgeable about temporary judges to serve as the Temporary Judge Administrator in that court.  (b) Duties of administrator  Under the supervision of the presiding judge, the Temporary Judge Administrator is responsible for the management of the temporary judges program in the court. The administrator\u2019s duties include:  (1) Receiving and processing applications from attorneys to serve as temporary judges with the court;  (2) Verifying the information on the applications;  (3) Assisting the presiding judge in the recruitment and selection of attorneys to serve as temporary judges, as provided in rule 10.741;  (4) Administering the court\u2019s program for the education and training of temporary judges;  (5) Maintaining records of attendance and completion of required courses by all attorneys serving as temporary judges in the court;   220 (6) Determining that attorneys have satisfied all the conditions required to be appointed as a temporary judge in that court, including continuing education requirements;  (7) Maintaining a list of attorneys currently appointed and qualified to serve as temporary judges in the court;  (8) Managing support services for temporary judges, such as providing mentoring programs and reference materials;  (9) Receiving and processing complaints and other information concerning the performance of attorneys serving as temporary judges;  (10) Assisting the presiding judge in identifying judicial needs that require the use of temporary judges and in addressing these needs; and  (11) Maintaining records, gathering statistics, and preparing and transmitting quarterly reports on the court\u2019s use of temporary judges as required under rule 10.742(c).  (Subd (b) amended effective July 1, 2012; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  Rule 10.743 amended effective July 1, 2012; adopted as rule 6.743 effective July 1, 2006; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007.  Advisory Committee Comment  The goal of this rule is to ensure the effective and efficient administration of the courts\u2019 use of temporary judges. The rule should be applied flexibly. In courts with large temporary judge programs, the court may want to designate a full-time administrator, and some of the administrator\u2019s duties may be delegated to other individuals. On the other hand, in courts that use only a few temporary judges, the Temporary Judge Administrator position may consume only part of the administrator\u2019s time and be combined with other duties. Also, courts that use only a small number of temporary judges may work with other courts, or may cooperate on a regional basis, to perform the functions and duties prescribed under this rule.  Rule 10.744.  Application procedures to serve as a court-appointed temporary judge  (a) Application  Every attorney who applies for appointment as a temporary judge in a trial court must complete an application to serve as a temporary judge.  (b) Information required  The attorney must provide all applicable information requested on the application.

(c) Continuing duty to disclose  An attorney appointed by a court to serve as a temporary judge has a continuing duty to disclose to the court any material changes in facts or circumstances that affect his or her ability to serve as a temporary judge. The attorney must disclose the changes to the court before the next time the attorney is assigned to serve as a temporary judge.  (d) Review of application  The presiding judge, assisted by the Temporary Judge Administrator, must review all applications and determine whether each applicant is qualified, has satisfied the requirements of rule 2.812, and should be appointed as a temporary judge. The presiding judge may delegate this task to another judge or a committee of judges, assisted by the Temporary Judge Administrator. In appointing attorneys as temporary judges, the presiding judge may go beyond the minimum qualifications and standards required under the California Rules of Court. The decision whether to appoint, use, retrain, remove, or discontinue using any particular attorney as a temporary judge is at the sole discretion of the presiding judge.

Rule 10.1017 adopted effective January 1, 2014.  Advisory Committee Comment   276 Business and Professions Code section 6086.7 requires a court to notify the State Bar of any of the following: (1) a final order of contempt imposed on an attorney that may involve grounds warranting discipline under the State Bar Act; (2) a modification or reversal of a judgment in a judicial proceeding based in whole or in part on the misconduct, incompetent representation, or willful misrepresentation of an attorney; (3) the imposition of any judicial sanctions on an attorney of $1,000 or more, except sanctions for failure to make discovery; or (4) the imposition of any civil penalty on an attorney under Family Code section 8620. If the notification pertains to a final order of contempt, Business and Professions Code section 6086.7(a)(1) requires the court to transmit to the State Bar a copy of the relevant minutes, final order, and transcript, if one exists. This rule is intended to clarify which justice has the responsibility of notifying the State Bar under section 6086.7 and the required contents of the notice.  In addition to the requirements stated in Business and Professions Code section 6086.7, judges are subject to canon 3D(2) of the California Code of Judicial Ethics, which states: \u201cWhenever a judge has personal knowledge, or concludes in a judicial decision, that a lawyer has committed misconduct or has violated any provision of the Rules of Professional Conduct, the judge shall take appropriate corrective action, which may include reporting the violation to the appropriate authority.\u201d The Advisory Committee Commentary states: \u201cAppropriate corrective action could include direct communication with the judge or lawyer who has committed the violation, other direct action, such as a confidential referral to a judicial or lawyer assistance program, or a report of the violation to the presiding judge, appropriate authority, or other agency or body. Judges should note that in addition to the action required by Canon 3D(2), California law imposes mandatory additional reporting requirements on judges regarding lawyer misconduct.

Subdivision (d) permits the Court of Appeal to keep an electronic copy of the reporter\u2019s transcript in lieu of keeping the original if the original transcript is in paper. Although subdivision (a) allows the Court of Appeal to maintain its records in any form that satisfies the otherwise applicable standards for maintenance of court records, including electronic forms, Code of Civil Procedure section 271 provides that an original reporter\u2019s transcript must be in electronic form unless a specified exception allows for an original paper transcript. Subdivision (d) therefore specifies that an electronic copy may be kept if the original transcript is in paper, to clarify that the paper original need not be kept by the court.  Rule 10.1030.

Waivers of court fees in decedents\u2019 estates, conservatorships, and guardianships  (a) Scope of rule  This rule governs initial fee waivers, as defined in rule 3.50(b), that are requested by petitioners for the appointment of fiduciaries, or by fiduciaries after their appointment, in decedents\u2019 estates, conservatorships, and guardianships under the Probate Code. The rule also governs initial fee waivers in other civil actions or proceedings in which conservators or guardians are parties representing the interests of their conservatees or wards.  (b) Court fee waiver requested by a petitioner for the appointment of a conservator or guardian of the person, estate, or person and estate of a conservatee or ward  A petitioner for the appointment of a conservator or guardian of the person, estate, or person and estate of a conservatee or ward must base an application for an initial fee waiver on the personal financial condition of the proposed conservatee or ward.  (c) Court fee waiver requested by a petitioner for the appointment of a personal representative of a decedent\u2019s estate  A petitioner for the appointment of a personal representative of a decedent\u2019s estate must base an application for an initial fee waiver on the petitioner\u2019s personal financial condition.   (d) Effect of appointment of a personal representative of a decedent\u2019s estate on a court fee waiver  The appointment of a personal representative of a decedent\u2019s estate may be a change of financial condition for fee waiver purposes under Government Code section 68636 in accordance with the following:   (1) If the successful petitioner is an appointed personal representative:  (A) The petitioner\u2019s continued eligibility for an initial fee waiver must be based on the combined financial condition of the petitioner and the decedent\u2019s estate.  4   (B) Upon marshaling or collecting assets of the decedent\u2019s estate following the petitioner\u2019s appointment and qualification as personal representative, the petitioner must notify the court of a change in financial condition under Government Code section 68636(a) that may affect his or her ability to pay all or a portion of the waived court fees and costs.  (C) The court may make a preliminary determination under Government Code section 68636(b) that the petitioner\u2019s appointment as fiduciary is a change of financial condition that makes the petitioner no longer eligible for an initial fee waiver based, in whole or in part, on the estimates of estate value and income contained in the petitioner\u2019s Petition for Probate . In that event, the court must give notice and conduct the hearing required by section 68636(b).  (2) If the successful petitioner is not an appointed personal representative:  (A) An initial fee waiver for that petitioner continues in effect according to its terms for subsequent fees incurred by that petitioner in the proceeding solely in his or her individual capacity.  (B) The appointed personal representative may apply for an initial fee waiver. The application must be based on the combined financial condition of the personal representative and the decedent\u2019s estate.  (e) Financial condition of the conservatee or ward  (1) The financial condition of the conservatee or ward for purposes of this rule includes:  (A) The financial condition\u2014to the extent of the information known or reasonably available to the conservator or guardian, or the petitioner for the conservator\u2019s or guardian\u2019s appointment, upon reasonable inquiry\u2014of any person who has a duty to support the conservatee or ward, including a spouse, registered domestic partner, or parent. A divorced spouse\u2019s or divorced registered domestic partner\u2019s duty to support a conservatee and a parent\u2019s duty to support a ward under this subparagraph is limited to the amount of support ordered by a court. Consideration of a support order as an element of the conservatee\u2019s or ward\u2019s financial condition under this rule is subject to the provisions of Government Code sections 68637(d) and (e), concerning the likelihood that the obligated person will pay all or any portion of the support ordered by the court;   5  (B) A conservatee\u2019s interest in community property that is outside the conservatorship estate and under the management or control of the conservatee\u2019s spouse or registered domestic partner; and  (C) The right to receive support, income, or other distributions from a trust or under a contract.

The conservator or guardian must report to the court any changes in the financial condition of the conservatee or ward that affects his or her ability to pay all or a portion of the court fees and costs that were initially waived, including any changes in the financial condition of the persons or property mentioned in subparagraphs (1)(A) and (1)(B) of this subdivision of which the conservator or guardian becomes aware after reasonable investigation.

(2) If property of the estate is eliminated from consideration for initial court fee waiver purposes because of one or more of the factors listed in (1), the court may determine that the estate can pay a portion of court fees, can pay court fees over time, or can pay court fees at a later time, under an equitable arrangement within the meaning of Government Code sections 68632(c) and 68634(e)(5). An equitable arrangement under this paragraph may include establishment of a lien for initially waived court fees against property distributable from a decedent\u2019s estate or payable to the conservatee or ward or other successor in interest at the termination of a conservatorship or guardianship.   6  (g) Payment of previously waived court fees by a decedent\u2019s estate  If the financial condition of a decedent\u2019s estate is a change of financial condition of a fee waiver applicant under this rule that results in withdrawal of a previously granted initial waiver of fees in favor of a petitioner for the appointment of a personal representative, the estate must pay to the court, as an allowable expense of administration, the fees and costs previously waived.  (h) Termination or modification of previously granted initial fee waivers  (1) Conservatorships and guardianships of the estate or person and estate   Upon establishment of a conservatorship or guardianship of the estate or person and estate, the court may collect all or a portion of court fees previously waived from the estate of the conservatee or ward if the court finds that the estate has the ability to pay the fees, or a portion thereof, immediately, over a period of time, or under some other equitable agreement, without using moneys that normally would pay for the common necessaries of life for the conservatee or ward and his or her family. The court must comply with the notice and hearing requirements of the second paragraph of Government Code section 68634(e)(5) to make the findings authorized in this paragraph.

Advisory Committee Comment   Subdivision (a) of this rule defines a court-funded trust as a product of three court proceedings. Two of these\u2014a petition for substituted judgment in a probate conservatorship (Prob. Code,  \u00a7 2580) and a proceeding for a particular transaction in the property of an impaired spouse or domestic partner without a conservator (Prob. Code, \u00a7 3100; Fam. Code, \u00a7 297.5)\u2014are regularly heard in the probate department of the court. The third proceeding, an application for an order approving the settlement of a minor\u2019s claim or a pending action involving a minor or person with a disability or approving the disposition of the proceeds of a judgment in favor of a minor or person with a disability (Prob. Code, \u00a7 3600), may be heard in either a probate or a civil department.  The Judicial Council has adopted standard 7.10 of the Standards of Judicial Administration to address proceedings under Probate Code section 3600 that involve court-funded trusts and are heard in civil departments. The standard makes two recommendations concerning the expertise of judicial officers who hear these proceedings on trust issues. The recommendations are to develop practices and procedures that (1) provide for determination of the trust issues in these matters by the probate department of the court or by a judicial officer who regularly hears probate proceedings or (2) ensure that judicial officers who hear these matters have experience or receive training in substantive and technical issues involving trusts, including special needs trusts.

Advisory Committee Comment  This rule requires the court to approve and allow attorney\u2019s fees in an amount that is reasonable under all the facts and circumstances, under Probate Code section 3601. The rule is declaratory of existing law concerning attorney\u2019s fees under a contingency fee agreement when the fees must be approved by the court. The facts and circumstances that the court may consider are discussed in a large body of decisional law under section 3601 and under other statutes that require the court to determine reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. The factors listed in rule 7.955(b) are modeled in part after those provided in rule 1.5 of the Rules of Professional Conduct of the State Bar of California concerning an unconscionable attorney\u2019s fee, but the advisory committee does not intend to suggest or imply that an attorney\u2019s fee must be found to be unconscionable under rule 1.5 to be determined to be unreasonable under this rule.   The rule permits, but does not require, the court to allow attorney\u2019s fees in an amount specified in a contingency fee agreement. The amount of attorney\u2019s fees allowed by the court must meet the reasonableness standard of section 3601 no matter how they are determined.    Chapter 21.  Guardianships  Rule 7.1001.

(3) At the beginning of any proceeding identified in (b)(1) and at any hearing in such a proceeding that may result in the appointment of a guardian or conservator, the court must:  (A) Ask each participant present whether the participant knows or has reason to know that the child is an Indian child;  (B) Instruct the parties to inform the court if they subsequently receive information that provides reason to know that the child is an Indian child; and  (C) Order the parent, Indian custodian, or existing guardian, if available, to complete Parental Notification of Indian Status  (form ICWA-020).  (4) If the parent, Indian custodian, or guardian is not available at the beginning of a proceeding identified in (b)(1), the court must order the petitioner to use reasonable diligence to find and inform the parent, Indian custodian, or guardian that the court has ordered that person to complete and deliver to the petitioner a Parental Notification of Indian Status (form ICWA-020).  (5) If the court or county investigator, the petitioner, or the attorney for a the petitioner knows or has reason to know or believe that an Indian child is the subject of the proceeding, but has not conclusively determined that the child is an Indian child, that person must, as soon as practicable, conduct further inquiry by:  (A) Interviewing the parents, Indian custodian, and \u201cextended family members\u201d to gather the information listed in Welfare and Institutions Code section 224.3(a)(5);  (B) Contacting the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs and the California Department of Social Services for assistance in identifying the names and contact information of the tribes of which the child may be a member or eligible for membership;  (C) Contacting the tribes and any other persons who reasonably can be expected to have information regarding the child\u2019s tribal membership or eligibility for membership.

(6) If the court knows or has reason to know or believe that an Indian child is involved in the proceeding, but does not have sufficient evidence to determine that the child is an Indian child, and the further inquiry conducted in (5) has not been conducted, the court must order one or more of the persons named in (5) to conduct the inquiry and submit the documentation described in that paragraph.  (7) The circumstances that may provide reason to believe the child may be an Indian child are those set forth in Welfare and Institutions Code section 224.2(e)(1). The circumstances that may provide reason to know the child is an Indian child are those set forth in Welfare and Institutions Code section 224.2(d) and rule 5.481(b).

(d) Temporary guardianships and conservatorships of an Indian child  In addition to the applicable requirements in Probate Code sections 2250\u20132257 and California Rules of Court, rules 7.1012 and 7.1062, the following requirements apply to temporary guardianship and conservatorship proceedings if the court knows or has reason to know that the proposed ward is an Indian child:  (1) Before appointing a temporary guardian or conservator of the person for an Indian child over the objection of a parent, tribe, or Indian custodian, the court must:  (A) Advise the parent or Indian custodian that if they cannot afford counsel, the court will appoint counsel for them under section 1912(b) of the Indian Child Welfare Act; and  (B) Find, in addition to facts in the petition establishing good cause for the appointment and any other showing the court may require under Probate Code section 2250(b), that the appointment is necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child.  73   (2) At a hearing under Probate Code section 2250(f) or on a petition, including an ex parte petition, to terminate a temporary guardianship or conservatorship of an Indian child, the court must determine whether the temporary guardianship or conservatorship is still necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child. If the court determines that the temporary guardianship or conservatorship is no longer necessary, the court must terminate the temporary guardianship or conservatorship and, if a parent or Indian custodian is available, order the child returned to the physical custody of the parent or Indian custodian.  (3) Before extending a temporary guardianship or conservatorship of an Indian child, under Probate Code section 2257(b), more than 30 days from the date of its establishment, the court must, in addition to finding good cause for the extension, determine that:  (A) Terminating the temporary guardianship or conservatorship would subject the child to imminent physical damage or harm;  (B) The court has been unable to transfer the proceeding to the jurisdiction of the appropriate Indian tribe; and  (C) It has not been possible to hold a hearing on the petition to appoint a guardian that complies with the substantive requirements of the Act for a foster care placement proceeding.  (Subd (d) adopted effective January 1, 2022.)  (e) Notice  If, at any time after the filing of a petition for appointment of a guardian or conservator for a minor child, the court or petitioner knows or has reason to know, within the meaning of Welfare and Institutions Code section 224.2(d) and rule 5.481(b), that an Indian child is the subject of the proceeding, the petitioner and the court must give notice of the proceeding and the right of the child\u2019s tribe to intervene in the manner prescribed by Welfare and Institutions Code section 224.3(a) and rule 5.481(c) to the child\u2019s parents, the child\u2019s Indian custodian or previously appointed guardian of the person, if any, and the child\u2019s tribe or, if the child\u2019s tribe has not been determined, all tribes of which the child may be a member or eligible for membership.

{"prompt": " (a) Definitions  As used in this rule, the following terms have the meanings specified:  (1) \u201cWard\u201d includes \u201cproposed ward.\u201d  (2) A \u201cproceeding\u201d is a matter before the court for decision in a probate guardianship of the person that concerns appointment or removal of a guardian, visitation, determination of the ward\u2019s place of residence, or termination of the guardianship by court order.  (3) \u201cParty,\u201d as used in this rule to refer to the ward, means a ward who has filed a petition or opposition to a petition concerning a proceeding or other matter subject to this rule.  (b) Purpose and scope of rule  (1) This rule applies Family Code section 3042 to the participation and testimony of the ward in a proceeding in a probate guardianship of the person. The testimony of other minors in a guardianship case is governed by Evidence Code sections 765(b) and 767(b).  (2) The court in its discretion may apply this rule, in whole or in part, to the participation and testimony of a ward in a guardianship of the estate or in a matter before the court in a guardianship of the person that is not a proceeding within the meaning of this rule. The phrase \u201cor other matter subject to this rule\u201d following the term \u201cproceeding\u201d is a reference to the matters described in this paragraph.  (3) No statutory mandate, rule, or practice requires a ward who is not a party to the proceeding or other matter subject to this rule to participate in court or prohibits him or her from doing so. When a ward desires to participate but is not a party to the proceeding or other matter subject to this rule, the court must balance the protection of the ward, the statutory duty to consider the wishes of and input from the ward, and the probative value of the ward\u2019s input while ensuring all parties\u2019 due process rights to challenge evidence relied on by the court in making decisions affecting the ward in matters covered by the rule.  (4) This rule rather than rule 5.250, on children\u2019s participation and testimony in family court proceedings, applies in probate guardianship proceedings.   75  (c) Determining whether the nonparty ward wishes to address the court  (1) The following persons must inform the court if they have information indicating that a ward who is not a party wishes to address the court in a proceeding or other matter subject to this rule:  (A) The ward\u2019s counsel;  (B) A court or county guardianship investigator;  (C) A child custody recommending counselor who provides recommendations to the judicial officer under Family Code section 3183;  (D) An expert appointed by the court under Evidence Code section 730 to assist the court in the matter; or  (E) The ward\u2019s guardian ad litem.  (2) The following persons may inform the court if they have information indicating that a ward who is not a party wishes to address the court in a proceeding or other matter subject to this rule:  (A) A party in the guardianship case; and  (B) An attorney for a party in the guardianship case.  (3) In the absence of information indicating that a ward who is not a party wishes to address the court in a proceeding or other matter subject to this rule, the judicial officer may inquire whether the ward wishes to do so.  (d) Guidelines for determining whether addressing the court is in the nonparty ward\u2019s best interest  (1) When a ward who is not a party indicates that he or she wishes to address the court, the judicial officer must consider whether involving the ward in the proceeding or other matter subject to this rule is in the ward\u2019s best interest.  (2) If the ward is 12 years old or older, the judicial officer must hear from the ward unless the court makes a finding that addressing the court is not in the ward\u2019s best interest and states the reasons on the record.  (3) In determining whether addressing the court is in the ward\u2019s best interest, the judicial officer should consider the following:   76  (A) Whether the ward is of sufficient age and capacity to form an intelligent preference as to the matter to be decided;  (B) Whether the ward is of sufficient age and capacity to understand the nature of testimony;  (C) Whether information has been presented indicating that the ward may be at risk emotionally if he or she is permitted or denied the opportunity to address the court or that the ward may benefit from addressing the court;  (D) Whether the subject areas about which the ward is anticipated to address the court are relevant to the decision the court must make;  (E) Whether the appointment of counsel under Probate Code section 1470 or a guardian ad litem for the ward would be helpful to the determination or would be necessary to protect the ward\u2019s interests; and  (F) Whether any other factors weigh in favor of or against having the ward address the court, taking into consideration the ward\u2019s desire to do so.  (e) Guidelines for receiving testimony and other input from the nonparty ward  (1) No testimony of a ward may be received without such testimony being heard on the record or in the presence of the parties. This requirement may not be waived.  (2) On deciding to take the testimony of a ward who is not a party in a proceeding or other matter subject to this rule, the judicial officer should balance the necessity of taking the ward\u2019s testimony in the courtroom with parents, the guardian or proposed guardian, other parties, and attorneys present with the need to create an environment in which the ward can be open and honest. In each case in which a ward\u2019s testimony will be taken, the judicial officer should consider:  (A) Where the testimony will be taken;  (B) Who should be present when the testimony is taken;  (C) How the ward will be questioned; and  (D) Whether a court reporter is available in all instances, but especially when the ward\u2019s testimony may be taken outside the presence of the parties and their attorneys. If the court reporter will not be available, whether there are other means to collect, preserve, transcribe, and make the ward\u2019s testimony available to parties and their attorneys.  77   (3) In taking testimony from a ward who is not a party to the proceeding or other matter subject to this rule, the court must take the special care required by Evidence Code section 765(b). If the ward is not represented by an attorney, the court must inform the ward in an age-appropriate manner about the limitations on confidentiality of testimony and that the information provided to the court will be on the record and provided to the parties in the case.  (4) In the process of listening to and inviting the ward\u2019s input, the court must allow but not require the ward to state a preference regarding the matter to be decided in the proceeding or other matter subject to this rule and should provide information in an age-appropriate manner about the process by which the court will make a decision.  (5) In any case in which a ward who is not a party to the proceeding or other matter subject to this rule will be called to testify, the court must consider the appointment of counsel for the ward under Probate Code section 1470 and may consider the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the ward. In addition to satisfying the requirements for minor\u2019s counsel under rule 7.1101, minor\u2019s counsel must:  (A) Provide information to the ward in an age-appropriate manner about the limitations on the confidentiality of testimony and indicate to the ward the possibility that information provided to the court will be on the record and provided to the parties in the case;  (B) Allow but not require the ward to state a preference regarding the issues to be decided in the proceeding or other matter subject to this rule, and provide information in an age-appropriate manner about the process by which the court will make a decision;  (C) If appropriate, provide the ward with an orientation to the courtroom or other place where the ward will testify; and  (D) Inform the parties and the court about the ward\u2019s desire to provide input.  (6) If the court precludes the calling of a ward who is not a party as a witness in a proceeding or other matter subject to this rule, alternatives for the court to obtain information or other input from the ward may include:  (A) A court or county guardianship investigator participating in the case under Probate Code section 1513 or 1513.2;  (B) Appointment of a child custody evaluator or investigator under Evidence Code section 730;  78   (C) Appointment of counsel or a guardian ad litem for the ward;  (D) Admissible evidence provided by the ward\u2019s parents, parties, or witnesses in the proceeding or other matter subject to this rule;  (E) Information provided by a child custody recommending counselor authorized under Family Code section 3183 to make a recommendation to the court; and  (F) Information provided from a child interview center or professional to avoid unnecessary multiple interviews.  (7) If the court precludes the calling of a ward who is not a party as a witness in a proceeding or other matter subject to this rule and specifies one of the other alternatives, the court must require that the information or evidence obtained by alternative means and provided by a professional (other than counsel for the ward or counsel for any party) or a nonparty:  (A) Be in writing and fully document the ward\u2019s views on the matters on which he or she wished to express an opinion;  (B) Describe the ward\u2019s input in sufficient detail to assist the court in making its decision;  (C) Be provided to the court and to the parties by a person who will be available for testimony and cross-examination; and  (D) Be filed in the confidential portion of the case file.  (f) Responsibilities of court-connected or appointed professionals\u2014all wards  A child custody evaluator, an expert witness appointed under Evidence Code section 730, an investigator, a child custody recommending counselor or other custody mediator appointed or assigned to meet with a ward must:  (1) Provide information to the ward in an age-appropriate manner about the limitations on confidentiality of testimony and the possibility that information provided to the professional may be shared with the court on the record and provided to the parties in the case;  (2) Allow but not require the ward to state a preference regarding the issues to be decided in the proceeding or other matter subject to this rule, and provide information in an age-appropriate manner about the process by which the court will make a decision; and   79  (3) Provide to the other parties in the case information about how best to support \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": " (g) Methods of providing information to parties and supporting nonparty wards  Courts should provide information to the parties and the ward who is not a party to the proceeding or other matter subject to this rule when the ward wants to participate or testify. Methods of providing information may include:  (1) Having court or county guardianship investigators and experts appointed under Evidence Code section 730 meet jointly or separately with the parties and their attorneys to discuss alternatives to having the ward provide direct testimony;  (2) Providing an orientation for the ward about the court process and the role of the judicial officer in making decisions, how the courtroom or chambers will be set up, and what participating or testifying will entail;  (3) Providing information to parties before the ward participates or testifies so that they can consider the possible effect on the ward of participating or not participating in the proceeding or other matter subject to this rule;  (4) Appointing counsel under Probate Code section 1470 or a guardian ad litem for the ward to assist in the provision of information to the ward concerning his or her decision to participate in the proceeding or testify;  (5) Including information in guardianship orientation presentations and publications about the options available to a ward who is not a party to the proceeding or other matter subject to this rule to participate or testify or not to do so, and the consequences of a ward\u2019s decision whether to become a party to the proceeding or other matter subject to this rule; and  (6) Providing an interpreter for the ward.  (h) If the ward is a party to the proceeding  (1) A ward who is a party to the proceeding or other matter subject to this rule is subject to the law of discovery applied to parties in civil actions and may be called as a witness by any other party unless the court makes a finding that providing information in response to discovery requests or testifying as a witness is not in the ward\u2019s best interest and states the reasons on the record.  (2) The court must consider appointing counsel under Probate Code section 1470 or a guardian ad litem for a ward who is a party to the proceeding or other matter subject to this rule if the ward is not represented by counsel.   80  (3) In determining whether providing information in response to discovery requests or testifying as a witness is in the ward\u2019s best interest, the judicial officer should consider the following:  (A) Whether information has been presented indicating that the ward may be at risk emotionally if he or she is permitted or denied the opportunity to provide information in response to discovery requests or by testimony;  (B) Whether the subject areas about which the ward is anticipated to provide information in response to discovery requests or by testimony are relevant to the decision the court must make; and  (C) Whether any other factors weigh in favor of or against having the ward provide information in response to discovery requests or by testimony.  (4) In taking testimony from a ward who is a party to the proceeding or other matter subject to this rule, the court must take the special care required by Evidence Code section 765(b). If the ward is not represented by an attorney, the court must inform the ward in an age-appropriate manner about the limitations on confidentiality of testimony and that the information provided to the court will be on the record and provided to the parties in the case.  (i) Education and training of judicial officers and court staff  Education and training content for court staff and judicial officers should include information on wards\u2019 participation in proceedings or other matters subject to this rule, methods other than direct testimony for receiving input from a ward, procedures for taking a ward\u2019s testimony, and differences in the application of this rule to wards who are and are not parties to the proceeding or other matters subject to this rule.

Standards of conduct for the conservator of the estate  Except as otherwise required by statute, in the exercise of ordinary care and diligence in managing and controlling the estate of the conservatee, the conservator of the estate is to be guided by the following principles:  (a) Avoidance of actual and apparent conflicts of interest with the conservatee  The conservator must avoid actual conflicts of interest and, consistent with his or her fiduciary duty to the conservatee, the appearance of conflicts of interest.  The conservator must avoid any personal, business, or professional interest or relationship that is or reasonably could be perceived as being self-serving or adverse to the best interest of the conservatee.  In particular:  (1) Except as appropriate for conservators who are not professional fiduciaries with full disclosure to the court, the conservator should not personally provide housing, medical, or legal services to the conservatee;  (2) The conservator must be independent from all service providers, except when (a) no other conservator or service providers are reasonably available, (b) the exception is in the best interest of the conservatee, (c) the circumstances are fully disclosed to the court, and (d) prior court approval has been obtained;  (3) The conservator must neither solicit nor accept incentives from service providers; and  (4) The conservator must not engage his or her family members to provide services to the conservatee for a profit or fee when other alternatives are reasonably available.  Where family members do provide such services, their relationship to the conservator must be fully disclosed to the court, the terms of engagement must be in the best interest of the conservatee compared to the  85  terms available from independent service providers, the services must be competently performed, and the conservator must be able to exercise appropriate control and supervision.

Advisory Committee Comment  Cross reference: Penal Code section 987.1.  Rule 4.101.  Bail in criminal cases  The fact that a defendant in a criminal case has or has not asked for a jury trial must not be taken into consideration in fixing the amount of bail and, once set, bail may not be increased or reduced by reason of such fact.  Rule 4.101 amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as rule 801 effective July 1, 1964; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001.  Rule 4.102.  Uniform bail and penalty schedules\u2014traffic, boating, fish and game, forestry, public utilities, parks and recreation, business licensing  The Judicial Council of California has established the policy of promulgating uniform bail and penalty schedules for certain offenses in order to achieve a standard of uniformity in the handling of these offenses.  3  In general, bail is used to ensure the presence of the defendant before the court. Under Vehicle Code sections 40512 and 13103, bail may also be forfeited and forfeiture may be ordered without the necessity of any further court proceedings and be treated as a conviction for specified Vehicle Code offenses. A penalty in the form of a monetary sum is a fine imposed as all or a portion of a sentence imposed.  To achieve substantial uniformity of bail and penalties throughout the state in traffic, boating, fish and game, forestry, public utilities, parks and recreation, and business licensing cases, the trial court judges, in performing their duty under Penal Code section 1269b to annually revise and adopt a schedule of bail and penalties for all misdemeanor and infraction offenses except Vehicle Code infractions, must give consideration to the Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedules approved by the Judicial Council. The Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedule for infraction violations of the Vehicle Code will be established by the Judicial Council in accordance with Vehicle Code section 40310. Judges must give consideration to requiring additional bail for aggravating or enhancing factors.  After a court adopts a countywide bail and penalty schedule, under Penal Code section 1269b, the court must, as soon as practicable, mail or e-mail a copy of the schedule to the Judicial Council with a report stating how the revised schedule differs from the council\u2019s uniform traffic bail and penalty schedule, uniform boating bail and penalty schedule, uniform fish and game bail and penalty schedule, uniform forestry bail and penalty schedule, uniform public utilities bail and penalty schedule, uniform parks and recreation bail and penalty schedule, or uniform business licensing bail and penalty schedule.  The purpose of this uniform bail and penalty schedule is to:  (1) Show the standard amount for bail, which for Vehicle Code offenses may also be the amount used for a bail forfeiture instead of further proceedings; and  (2) Serve as a guideline for the imposition of a fine as all or a portion of the penalty for a first conviction of a listed offense where a fine is used as all or a portion of the penalty for such offense. The amounts shown for the misdemeanors on the boating, fish and game, forestry, public utilities, parks and recreation, and business licensing bail and penalty schedules have been set with this dual purpose in mind.  Unless otherwise shown, the maximum penalties for the listed offenses are six months in the county jail or a fine of $1,000, or both. The penalty amounts are intended to be used to provide standard fine amounts for a first offense conviction of a violation shown where a fine is used as all or a portion of the sentence imposed.

Rule 4.103. Notice to appear forms  (a) Traffic offenses   A printed or electronic notice to appear that is issued for any violation of the Vehicle Code other than a felony or for a violation of an ordinance of a city or county relating to traffic offenses must be prepared and filed with the court on  Automated Traffic Enforcement System Notice to Appear  (form TR-115), Traffic/Nontraffic Notice to Appear  (form TR-130), Electronic Traffic/Nontraffic Notice to Appear (4-inch format) (form TR-135), or Electronic Traffic/Nontraffic Notice to Appear (3-inch format) (form TR-145), and must comply with the requirements in the current version of the Judicial Council\u2019s instructions,  Notice to Appear and Related Forms (form TR-INST).  (b) Nontraffic offenses   A notice to appear issued for a nontraffic infraction or misdemeanor offense that is prepared on Nontraffic Notice to Appear  (form TR-120), Traffic/Nontraffic Notice to Appear  (form TR-130), Electronic Traffic/Nontraffic Notice to Appear  (4-inch format) (form TR-135), or Electronic Traffic/Nontraffic Notice to Appear (3-inch format) (form TR-145), and that complies with the requirements in the current version of the Judicial Council\u2019s instructions, Notice to Appear and Related Forms  (form TR-INST), may be filed with the court and serve as a complaint as provided in Penal Code section 853.9 or 959.1.

(b) Authority of a court clerk to grant a request to attend traffic violator school  (1) Eligible offenses   Except as provided in (2), a court clerk is authorized to grant a request to attend traffic violator school when a defendant with a valid driver\u2019s license requests to attend an 8-hour traffic violator school under Vehicle Code sections 41501(a) and 42005 for any infraction under divisions 11 and 12 \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": "violation is reportable to the Department of Motor Vehicles.  (2) Ineligible offenses   A court clerk is not authorized to grant a request to attend traffic  violator school for a misdemeanor or any of the following infractions:  (A) A violation that carries a negligent operator point count of more than one point under Vehicle Code section 12810 or one and one-half points or more under Vehicle Code section 12810.5(b)(2);  (B) A violation that occurs within 18 months after the date of a previous violation and the defendant either attended or elected to attend a traffic violator school for the previous violation (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1808.7 and 1808.10);  6  (C) A violation of Vehicle Code section 22406.5 (tank vehicles);  (D) A violation related to alcohol use or possession or drug use or possession;  (E) A violation on which the defendant failed to appear under Vehicle Code section 40508(a) unless the failure-to-appear charge has been adjudicated and any fine imposed has been paid;  (F) A violation on which the defendant has failed to appear under Penal Code section 1214.1 unless the civil monetary assessment has been paid;  (G) A speeding violation in which the speed alleged is more than 25 miles over a speed limit as stated in Chapter 7 (commencing with section 22348) of Division 11 of the Vehicle Code; and  (H) A violation that occurs in a commercial vehicle as defined in Vehicle Code section 15210(b).

(c) Judicial discretion   (1) A judicial officer may in his or her discretion order attendance at a traffic violator school in an individual case as permitted under Vehicle Code section 41501(a) or 42005 or for any other purpose permitted by law. A defendant having a class A, class B, or commercial class C driver\u2019s license may request to attend traffic violator school if the defendant was operating a vehicle requiring only a noncommercial class C or class M license. The record of conviction after completion of traffic violator school by a driver who holds a class A, class B, or commercial class C license must not be reported as confidential. A defendant charged with a violation that occurs in a commercial vehicle, as defined in Vehicle Code section 15210(b), is not eligible to attend traffic violator school under Vehicle Code sections 41501 or 42005 in lieu of adjudicating an offense, to receive a confidential conviction, or to avoid violator point counts.   (2) A defendant who is otherwise eligible for traffic violator school is not made ineligible by entering a plea other than guilty or by exercising his or her right to trial. A traffic violator school request must be considered based on the individual circumstances of the specific case. The court is not required to state on the record a reason for granting or denying a traffic violator school request.    7  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2013; amended and relettered as part of subd (b) effective January 1, 2003; previously amended effective January 1, 1998, September 20, 2005, January 1, 2007, January 1, 2007, and July 1, 201.)  Rule 4.104 amended effective January 1, 2013; adopted as rule 851 effective January 1, 1997; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 1998, July 1, 2001, January 1, 2003, September 20, 2005, January 1, 2007 and July 1, 2011.  Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivision (c)(1).  Rule 4.104(c)(1) reflects that under Vehicle Code sections 1808.10, 41501, and 42005, the record of a driver with a class A, class B, or commercial class C license who completes a traffic violator school program is not confidential and must be reported to and disclosed by the Department of Motor Vehicles for purposes of Title 49 of the Federal Code of Regulations and to insurers for underwriting and rating purposes.   Subdivision (c)(2).  Rule 4.104(c)(2) reflects court rulings in cases where defendants wished to plead not guilty and have the court order attendance of traffic violator school if found guilty after trial. A court has discretion to grant or not grant traffic violator school. ( People v. Schindler  (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 431, 433; People v. Levinson  (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d Supp. 13, 21.) However, the court may not arbitrarily refuse to consider a request for traffic violator school because a defendant pleads not guilty. ( Schindler,  supra, at p. 433; People v. Wozniak  (1987) 197 Cal.App.3d Supp. 43, 44; People v. Enochs  (1976) 62 Cal.App.3d Supp. 42, 44.) If a judicial officer believes that a defendant\u2019s circumstances indicate that a defendant would benefit from attending school, such attendance should be authorized and should not be affected by the order in which the plea, explanation, and request for traffic violator school are presented. ( Enochs, supra,  at p. 44.) A court is not required to state its reasons for granting or denying traffic violator school following a defendant\u2019s conviction for a traffic violation. ( Schindler, supra,  at p. 433.)  Rule 4.105.  Appearance without deposit of bail in infraction cases  (a) Application  This rule applies to any infraction for which the defendant has received a written notice to appear.  (Subd (a) amended effective December 1, 2015.)  (b) Appearance without deposit of bail  Except as provided in (c), courts must allow a defendant to appear for arraignment and trial without deposit of bail.  (c) Deposit of bail  (1) Courts must require the deposit of bail when the defendant elects a statutory procedure that requires the deposit of bail.   8  (2) Courts may require the deposit of bail when the defendant does not sign a written promise to appear as required by the court.  (3)  Courts may require a deposit of bail before trial if the court determines that the defendant is unlikely to appear as ordered without a deposit of bail and the court expressly states the reasons for the finding.  (4) In determining the amount of bail set under (2) and (3), courts must consider the totality of the circumstances.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2017; previously amended effective December 1, 2015.)  (d) Notice  Courts must inform defendants of the option to appear in court without the deposit of bail in any instructions or other materials courts provide for the public that relate to bail for infractions, including any website information, written instructions, courtesy notices, and forms.  (Subd (d) amended effective December 1, 2015.)  (e) Local Website Information  The website for each trial court must include a link to the traffic self-help information posted at: http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-traffic.htm .  (Subd (e) adopted effective January 1, 2017.)  Rule 4.105 amended effective January 1, 2017; adopted effective June 8, 2015; previously amended December 1, 2015.  Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivision (a).  The rule is intended to apply only to an infraction violation for which the defendant has received a written notice to appear and has appeared by the appearance date or an approved extension of that date. The rule does not apply to postconviction matters or cases in which the defendant seeks an appearance in court after a failure to appear or pay.  Subdivision (c).  This subdivision takes into account the distinct statutory purposes and functions that bail and related considerations serve in infraction cases, including, for example, the posting and forfeiting of bail in uncontested cases and the use of bail to satisfy later judgments, as distinguished from felony and most misdemeanor cases.  Subdivision (c)(1). Various statutory provisions authorize infraction defendants who have received a written notice to appear to elect to deposit bail in lieu of appearing in court or in advance of the notice to appear date. (See, e.g., Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 40510 [authorizing defendants to  9 deposit bail before the notice to appear date]; 40519(a) [authorizing defendants who have received a written notice to appear to declare the intention to plead not guilty and deposit bail before the notice to appear date for purposes of electing to schedule an arraignment and trial on the same date or on separate dates]; 40519(b) [authorizing defendants who have received a written notice to appear to deposit bail and plead not guilty in writing in lieu of appearing in person]; and 40902 [authorizing trial by written declaration].)   This rule is not intended to modify or contravene any statutorily authorized alternatives to appearing in court. (See, e.g., Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 853.5, 853.6; Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 40510, 40512, and 40512.5 [authorizing defendants to post and forfeit bail in lieu of appearing for arraignment].) The purpose of this rule is to clarify that if the defendant declines to use a statutorily authorized alternative, courts must allow the defendant to appear without prior deposit of bail as provided above.  Subdivision (c)(2). As used in this subdivision, the phrase \u201cwritten promise to appear as required by the court\u201d refers to a signed promise, made by a defendant who has appeared in court, to return to court on a future date and time as ordered by the court.  Subdivision (c)(3).  In exercising discretion to require deposit of bail on a particular case, courts should consider, among other factors, whether previous failures to pay or appear were willful or involved adequate notice.    Subdivision (c)(4). In considering the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d under this subdivision, courts may consider whether the bail amount would impose an undue hardship on the defendant.   Rule 4.106.  Failure to appear or failure to pay for a Notice to Appear  issued for an infraction offense  (a) Application  This rule applies to infraction offenses for which the defendant has received a written notice to appear and has failed to appear or failed to pay.  (b) Definitions  As used in this rule, \u201cfailure to appear\u201d and \u201cfailure to pay\u201d mean failure to appear and failure to pay as defined in section 1214.1(a).  (c) Procedure for consideration of good cause for failure to appear or pay  (1) A notice of a civil assessment under section 1214.1(b) must inform the defendant of his or her right to petition that the civil assessment be vacated for good cause and must include information about the process for vacating or reducing the assessment.  (2) When a notice of civil assessment is given, a defendant may, within the time specified in the notice, move by written petition to vacate or reduce the assessment.   10  (3) When a court imposes a civil assessment for failure to appear or pay, the defendant may petition that the court vacate or reduce the civil assessment without paying any bail, fines, penalties, fees, or assessments.    (4) A petition to vacate an assessment does not stay the operation of any order requiring the payment of bail, fines, penalties, fees, or assessment unless specifically ordered by the court.  (5) The court must vacate the assessment upon a showing of good cause under \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": " (6) If the defendant does not establish good cause, the court may still exercise its discretion under section 1214.1(a) to reconsider:  (A) Whether a civil assessment should be imposed; and  (B) If so, the amount of the assessment.  (7) In exercising its discretion, the court may consider such factors as a defendant\u2019s due diligence in appearing or paying after notice of the assessment has been given under section 1214.1(b)(1) and the defendant\u2019s financial circumstances.  (d) Procedure for unpaid bail referred to collection as delinquent debt in unadjudicated cases  (1) When a case has not been adjudicated and a court refers it to a comprehensive collection program as provided in section 1463.007(b)(1) as delinquent debt, the defendant may schedule a hearing for adjudication of the underlying charge(s) without payment of the bail amount.  (2) The defendant may request an appearance date to adjudicate the underlying charges by written petition or alternative method provided by the court. Alternatively, the defendant may request or the court may direct a court appearance.  (3) A court may require a deposit of bail before adjudication of the underlying charges if the court finds that the defendant is unlikely to appear as ordered without a deposit of bail and the court expressly states the reasons for the finding. The court must not require payment of the civil assessment before adjudication.  (e) Procedure for failure to pay or make a payment under an installment payment plan   11 (1) When a defendant fails to pay a fine or make a payment under an installment plan as provided in section 1205 or Vehicle Code sections 40510.5, 42003, or 42007, the court must permit the defendant to appear by written petition to modify the payment terms. Alternatively, the defendant may request or the court may direct a court appearance.  (2) The court must not require payment of bail, fines, penalties, fees, or assessments to consider the petition.  (3) The petition to modify the payment terms does not stay the operation of any order requiring the payment of bail, fines, penalties, fees, or assessments unless specifically ordered by the court.  (4) If the defendant petitions to modify the payment terms based on an inability to pay, the procedures stated in rule 4.335 apply.  (5) If the petition to modify the payment terms is not based on an inability to pay, the court may deny the defendant\u2019s request to modify the payment terms and order no further proceedings if the court determines that:  (A) An unreasonable amount of time has passed; or  (B) The defendant has made an unreasonable number of requests to modify the payment terms.  (f) Procedure after a trial by written declaration in absentia for a traffic infraction  When the court issues a judgment under Vehicle Code section 40903 and a defendant requests a trial de novo within the time permitted, courts may require the defendant to deposit bail.   (g) Procedure for referring a defendant to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for license suspension for failure to pay a fine  Before a court may notify the DMV under Vehicle Code sections 40509(b) or 40509.5(b) that a defendant has failed to pay a fine or an installment of bail, the court must provide the defendant with notice of and an opportunity to be heard on the inability to pay. This notice may be provided on the notice required in rule 4.107, the civil assessment notice, or any other notice provided to the defendant.   Rule 4.106 adopted effective January 1, 2017  Advisory Committee Comment   12 Subdivision (a). The rule is intended to apply only to an infraction offense for which the defendant (1) has received a written notice to appear and (2) has failed to appear by the appearance date or an approved extension of that date or has failed to pay as required.  Subdivision (c)(3).  Circumstances that indicate good cause may include, but are not limited to, the defendant\u2019s hospitalization, incapacitation, or incarceration; military duty required of the defendant; death or hospitalization of the defendant\u2019s dependent or immediate family member; caregiver responsibility for a sick or disabled dependent or immediate family member of the defendant; or an extraordinary reason, beyond the defendant\u2019s control, that prevented the defendant from making an appearance or payment on or before the date listed on the notice to appear.  Subdivision (e)(1) . A court may exercise its discretion to deny a defendant\u2019s request to modify the payment terms. If the court chooses to grant the defendant\u2019s request, the court may modify the payment terms by reducing or suspending the base fine, lowering the payments, converting the remaining balance to community service, or otherwise modifying the payment terms as the court sees fit.  Subdivision (g).  A hearing is not required unless requested by the defendant or directed by the court.  Rule 4.107.  Mandatory reminder notice\u2015traffic procedures  (a) Mandatory reminder notice  (1) Each court must send a reminder notice to the address shown on the Notice to Appear, unless the defendant otherwise notifies the court of a different address.  (2) The court may satisfy the requirement in paragraph (1) by sending the notice electronically, including by e-mail or text message, to the defendant. By providing an electronic address or number to the court or to a law enforcement officer at the time of signing the promise to appear, a defendant consents to receiving the reminder notice electronically at that electronic address or number.  (3) The failure to receive a reminder notice does not relieve the defendant of the obligation to appear by the date stated in the Notice to Appear .  (b) Minimum information in reminder notice   In addition to information obtained from the Notice to Appear , the reminder notice must contain at least the following information:  (1) An appearance date and location;  (2)  Whether a court appearance is mandatory or optional;   13 (3) The total bail amount and payment options;  (4) The notice about traffic school required under Vehicle Code section 42007, if applicable;  (5) Notice that a traffic violator school will charge a fee in addition to the administrative fee charged by the court;  (6) The potential consequences for failure to appear, including a driver\u2019s license hold or suspension, a civil assessment of up to $300, a new charge for failure to appear, a warrant of arrest, or some combination of these consequences, if applicable;  (7) The potential consequences for failure to pay a fine, including a driver\u2019s license hold or suspension, a civil assessment of up to $300, a new charge for failure to pay a fine, a warrant of arrest, or some combination of these consequences, if applicable;  (8) The right to request an ability-to-pay determination;   (9) Notice of the option to pay bail through community service (if available) and installment plans (if available);   (10) Contact information for the court, including the court\u2019s website;  (11) Information regarding trial by declaration, informal trial (if available), and telephone or website scheduling options (if available); and  (12) Correction requirements and procedures for correctable violations.

The court may provide a means for obtaining the defendant\u2019s consent and designated electronic address or number on its local website. Because notices to appear state the website address for the superior court in each county, this location may increase the number of defendants who become aware and take advantage of this option. To obtain the defendant\u2019s electronic address or number at the time of signing the promise to appear, the court may need to collaborate with local law enforcement agencies.   Subdivision (b). While not required, some local court websites may provide information about local court processes and local forms related to the information on the reminder notice. If in electronic form, the reminder notice should include direct links to any information and forms on the local court website. If in paper form, the reminder notice may include the website addresses for any information and forms on the local court website.   14 Rule 4.108.  Installment Payment Agreements  (a) Online interface for installment payment agreements  (1) A court may use an online interface to enter into installment payment agreements with traffic infraction defendants under Vehicle Code sections 40510.5 and 42007.  (2) Before entering into an installment payment agreement, an online interface must provide defendants with the Advisement of Rights stated in Attachment 1 of Online Agreement to Pay and Forfeit Bail in Installments  (form TR-300 (online)), and Online Agreement to Pay Traffic Violator School Fees in Installments (form TR-310 (online)).   (b) Alternative mandatory forms  (1) The Judicial Council has adopted the following alternative mandatory forms for use in entering into installment payment agreements under Vehicle Code sections 40510.5 and 42007:   (A)  Agreement to Pay and Forfeit Bail in Installments (form TR-300); and Online Agreement to Pay and Forfeit Bail in Installments (form TR-300 (online)); and  (B)  Agreement to Pay Traffic Violator School Fees in Installments  (form TR-310); and Online Agreement to Pay Traffic Violator School Fees in Installments  (form TR-310 (online)).  (2) Forms TR-300 (online) and TR-310 (online) may be used only in online interfaces for installment payment agreements as provided in subdivision (a).

Rule 4.112.  Readiness conference  (a) Date and appearances   The court may hold a readiness conference in felony cases within 1 to 14 days before the date set for trial. At the readiness conference:  (1) All trial counsel must appear and be prepared to discuss the case and determine whether the case can be disposed of without trial;  (2) The prosecuting attorney must have authority to dispose of the case; and   (3) The defendant must be present in court.

Rule 4.114 amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as rule 227.9 effective January 1, 1985; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2001.  Rule 4.115.  Criminal case assignment  (a) Master calendar departments  To ensure that the court\u2019s policy on continuances is firm and uniformly applied, that pretrial proceedings and trial assignments are handled consistently, and that cases are tried on a date certain, each court not operating on a direct calendaring system must assign all criminal matters to one or more master calendar departments. The presiding judge of a master calendar department must conduct or supervise the conduct of all arraignments and pretrial hearings and conferences and assign to a trial department any case requiring a trial or dispositional hearing.   17 (Subd (a) lettered effective January 1, 2008; adopted as unlettered subd effective January 1, 1985.)  (b) Trial calendaring and continuances  Any request for a continuance, including a request to trail the trial date, must comply with rule 4.113 and the requirement in section 1050 to show good cause to continue a hearing in a criminal proceeding. Active management of trial calendars is necessary to minimize the number of statutory dismissals. Accordingly, courts should avoid calendaring or trailing criminal cases for trial to the last day permitted for trial under section 1382. Courts must implement calendar management procedures, in accordance with local conditions and needs, to ensure that criminal cases are assigned to trial departments before the last day permitted for trial under section 1382.    (Subd (b) adopted effective January 1, 2008.)  Rule 4.115 amended effective January 1, 2008; adopted as section 10 of the Standards of Judicial Administration effective January 1, 1985; amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.  Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivision (b) clarifies that the \u201cgood cause\u201d showing for a continuance under section 1050 applies in all criminal cases, whether or not the case is in the 10-day grace period provided for in section 1382. The Trial Court Presiding Judges Advisory Committee and Criminal Law Advisory Committee observe that the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement for a continuance is separate and distinct from the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement to avoid dismissals under section 1382. There is case law stating that the prosecution is not required to show good cause to avoid a dismissal under section 1382 during the 10-day grace period because a case may not be dismissed for delay during that 10-day period. (See, e.g., Bryant v. Superior Court (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 483, 488.) Yet, both the plain language of section 1050 and case law show that there must be good cause for a continuance under section 1050 during the 10-day grace period. (See, e.g., section 1050 and People v. Henderson  (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 922, 939\u2013940.) Thus, a court may not dismiss a case during the 10-day grace period under section 1382, but the committees believe that the court must deny a request for a continuance during the 10-day grace period that does not comply with the good cause requirement under section 1050.  The decision in Henderson  states that when the prosecutor seeks a continuance but fails to show good cause under section 1050, the trial court \u201cmust nevertheless postpone the hearing to another date within the statutory period.\u201d (115 Cal.App.4th at p. 940.) That conclusion, however, may be contrary to the plain language of section 1050, which requires a court to deny a continuance if the moving party fails to show good cause. The conclusion also appears to be dicta, as it was not a contested issue on appeal. Given this uncertainty, the rule is silent as to the remedy for failure to show good cause for a requested continuance during the 10-day grace period. The committees note that the remedies under section 1050.5 are available and, but for the Henderson  dicta, a court would appear to be allowed to deny the continuance request and commence the trial on the scheduled trial date.   18 Rule 4.116.  Certification to juvenile court  (a) Application   This rule applies to all cases not filed in juvenile court in which the person charged by an accusatory pleading appears to be under the age of 18, except when jurisdiction over the child has been transferred from the juvenile court under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707.  (Subd (a) amended effective May 22, 2017; adopted effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Procedure to determine whether certification is appropriate   If an accusatory pleading is pending, and it is suggested or it appears to the court that the person charged was under the age of 18 on the date the offense is alleged to have been committed, the court must immediately suspend proceedings and conduct a hearing to determine the true age of the person charged. The burden of proof of establishing the age of the accused person is on the moving party. If, after examination, the court is satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence that the person was under the age of 18 on the date the alleged offense was committed, the court must immediately certify the matter to the juvenile court and state on the certification order:  (1) The crime with which the person named is charged;  (2) That the person was under the age of 18 on the date of the alleged offense;  (3) The date of birth of the person;  (4) The date of suspension of criminal proceedings; and  (5) The date and time of certification to juvenile court.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as untitled subd effective January 1, 1991; previously amended and lettered effective January 1, 2001.)  (c) Procedure on certification  If the court determines that certification to the juvenile court is appropriate under (b), copies of the certification, the accusatory pleading, and any police reports must immediately be transmitted to the clerk of the juvenile court. On receipt of the documents, the clerk of the juvenile court must immediately notify the probation officer, who must immediately investigate the matter to determine whether to commence proceedings in juvenile court.   19 (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as untitled subd effective January 1, 1991; previously amended and lettered effective January 1, 2001.)  (d) Procedure if child is in custody  If the person is under the age of 18 and is in custody, the person must immediately be transported to the juvenile detention facility.

If the court appoints counsel under this subdivision, it must state on the record the basis for finding counsel qualified. In making this determination, the court must consider whether the attorney meets the following qualifications:  (1) The attorney is an active member of the State Bar of California or admitted to practice pro hac vice under rule 9.40;  (2) The attorney has demonstrated the necessary proficiency, diligence, and quality of representation appropriate to capital cases;  (3) The attorney has had extensive criminal or civil trial experience;  (4) Although not meeting the qualifications stated in (d) or (e), the attorney has had experience in death penalty trials other than as lead or associate counsel;  (5) The attorney is familiar with the practices and procedures of the California criminal courts;   (6) The attorney is familiar with and experienced in the use of expert witnesses and evidence, including psychiatric and forensic evidence;   22 (7) The attorney has had specialized training in the defense of persons accused of capital crimes, such as experience in a death penalty resource center;  (8) The attorney has ongoing consultation support from experienced death penalty counsel;   (9) The attorney has completed within the past two years before appointment at least 15 hours of capital case defense training approved for Minimum Continuing Legal Education credit by the State Bar of California; and   (10) The attorney has been certified by the State Bar of California\u2019s Board of Legal Specialization as a criminal law specialist.  (Subd (f) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (g) Public defender appointments   When the court appoints the Public Defender under Penal Code section 987.2, the Public Defender should assign an attorney from that office or agency as lead counsel who meets the qualifications described in (d) or assign an attorney that he or she determines would qualify under (f).

(c) Lists of appearances, exhibits, and motions  (1) Primary counsel for each defendant and the prosecution must each prepare the lists identified in (A)\u2013(C):  (A) A list of all appearances made by that party during the pretrial proceedings. Capital Case Attorney List of Appearances  (form CR-601) must be used for this purpose. The list must include all appearances, including ex parte appearances; the date of each appearance; the department in which it was made; the name of counsel making the appearance; and a brief description of the nature of the appearance. A separate list of Penal Code section 987.9 appearances must be maintained under seal for each defendant.  (B) A list of all exhibits offered by that party during the pretrial proceedings.

The list must indicate if a motion is awaiting resolution.  (2) In the event of any substitution of attorney during the pretrial proceedings, the relieved attorney must provide the lists of all appearances, exhibits, and motions to substituting counsel within five days of being relieved.  (3) No later than 21 days after the clerk notifies trial counsel that it must submit the lists to the court, counsel must submit the lists to the court and serve on  24 all parties a copy of all the lists except the list of Penal Code section 987.9 appearances. Unless otherwise provided by local rule, the lists must be submitted to the court in electronic form.

Capital Case Attorney Pretrial Checklist  (form CR-600) is designed to be a tool to assist pretrial counsel in identifying and fulfilling all their record preparation responsibilities. Counsel are therefore encouraged to keep a copy of this form and to use it to monitor their own progress.  Subdivision (c)(1). To facilitate preparation of complete and accurate lists, counsel are encouraged to add items to the lists at the time appearances or motions are made or exhibits offered.  Subdivision (c)(3). Rule 8.613(d) requires the clerk to notify counsel to submit the lists of appearances, exhibits, and motions.   Rule 4.130.  Mental competency proceedings  (a) Application  (1) This rule applies to proceedings in the superior court under Penal Code section 1367 et seq. to determine the mental competency of a criminal defendant.  (2) The requirements of subdivision (d)(2) apply only to a formal competency evaluation ordered by the court under Penal Code section 1369(a).  (3) The requirements of subdivision (d)(2) do not apply to a brief preliminary evaluation of the defendant\u2019s competency if:  (A) The parties stipulate to a brief preliminary evaluation; and  (B) The court orders the evaluation in accordance with a local rule of court that specifies the content of the evaluation and the procedure for its preparation and submission to the court.   25 (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2018.)  (b) Initiation of mental competency proceedings  (1) The court must initiate mental competency proceedings if the judge has a reasonable doubt, based on substantial evidence, about the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial.  (2) The opinion of counsel, without a statement of specific reasons supporting that opinion, does not constitute substantial evidence.  The court may allow defense counsel to present his or her opinion regarding the defendant\u2019s mental competency in camera if the court finds there is reason to believe that attorney-client privileged information will be inappropriately revealed if the hearing is conducted in open court.  (3)  In a felony case, if the judge initiates mental competency proceedings prior to the preliminary examination, counsel for the defendant may request a preliminary examination as provided in Penal Code section 1368.1(a)(1), or counsel for the People may request a determination of probable cause as provided in Penal Code section 1368.1(a)(2) and rule 4.131.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2020.)  (c) Effect of initiating mental competency proceedings  (1)  If mental competency proceedings are initiated, criminal proceedings are suspended and may not be reinstated until a trial on the competency of the defendant has been concluded and the defendant is found mentally competent at a trial conducted under Penal Code section 1369, at a hearing conducted under Penal Code section 1370(a)(1)(G), or at a hearing following a certification of restoration under Penal Code section 1372.   (2) In misdemeanor cases, speedy trial requirements are tolled during the suspension of criminal proceedings for mental competency evaluation and trial.  If criminal proceedings are later reinstated and time is not waived, the trial must be commenced within 30 days after the reinstatement of the criminal proceedings, as provided by Penal Code section 1382(a)(3).  (3) In felony cases, speedy trial requirements are tolled during the suspension of criminal proceedings for mental competency evaluation and trial.  If criminal proceedings are reinstated, unless time is waived, time periods to commence the preliminary examination or trial are as follows:  (A) If criminal proceedings were suspended before the preliminary hearing had been conducted, the preliminary hearing must be commenced within 10 days of the reinstatement of the criminal proceedings, as provided in Penal Code section 859b.  26  (B) If criminal proceedings were suspended after the preliminary hearing \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}

(d) Examination of defendant after initiation of mental competency proceedings  (1) On initiation of mental competency proceedings, the court must inquire whether the defendant, or defendant\u2019s counsel, seeks a finding of mental incompetence.  (2)  Any court-appointed experts must examine the defendant and advise the court on the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial. Experts\u2019 reports are to be submitted to the court, counsel for the defendant, and the prosecution. The report must include the following:  (A) A brief statement of the examiner\u2019s training and previous experience as it relates to examining the competence of a criminal defendant to stand trial and preparing a resulting report;  (B) A summary of the examination conducted by the examiner on the defendant, including a summary of the defendant\u2019s mental status, a diagnosis under the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , if possible, of the defendant\u2019s current mental health disorder or disorders, and a statement as to whether symptoms of the mental health disorder or disorders which motivated the defendant\u2019s behavior would respond to mental health treatment;  (C) A detailed analysis of the competence of the defendant to stand trial using California\u2019s current legal standard, including the defendant\u2019s ability or inability to understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or assist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a rational manner as a result of a mental health disorder;  (D) A summary of an assessment\u2014conducted for malingering or feigning symptoms, if clinically indicated\u2014which may include, but need not be limited to, psychological testing;  (E) Under Penal Code section 1369, a statement on whether treatment with antipsychotic or other medication is medically appropriate for the defendant, whether the treatment is likely to restore the defendant to mental competence, a list of likely or potential side effects of the medication, the expected efficacy of the medication, possible  27 alternative treatments, whether it is medically appropriate to administer antipsychotic or other medication in the county jail, and whether the defendant has capacity to make decisions regarding antipsychotic or other medication. If an examining psychologist is of the opinion that a referral to a psychiatrist is necessary to address these issues, the psychologist must inform the court of this opinion and his or her recommendation that a psychiatrist should examine the defendant;  (F) A list of all sources of information considered by the examiner, including legal, medical, school, military, regional center, employment, hospital, and psychiatric records; the evaluations of other experts; the results of psychological testing; police reports; criminal history; statement of the defendant; statements of any witnesses to the alleged crime; booking information, mental health screenings, and mental health records following the alleged crime; consultation with the prosecutor and defendant\u2019s attorney; and any other collateral sources considered in reaching his or her conclusion;  (G) If the defendant is charged with a felony offense, a recommendation, if possible, for a placement or type of placement or treatment program that is most appropriate for restoring the defendant to competency; and  (H) If the defendant is charged only with a misdemeanor offense, an opinion based on present clinical impressions and available historical data as to whether the defendant, regardless of custody status, appears to be gravely disabled, as defined in Welfare and Institutions Code section 5008(h)(1)(A).  (3)  Statements made by the defendant during the examination to experts appointed under this rule, and products of any such statements, may not be used in a trial on the issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt or in a sanity trial should defendant enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.

(e) Trial on mental competency  (1) Regardless of the conclusions or findings of the court-appointed expert, the court must conduct a trial on the mental competency of the defendant if the court has initiated mental competency proceedings under (b).  (2) At the trial, the defendant is presumed to be mentally competent, and it is the burden of the party contending that the defendant is not mentally competent to prove the defendant\u2019s mental incompetence by a preponderance of the evidence.   28 (3) In addition to the testimony of the experts appointed by the court under (d), either party may call additional experts or other relevant witnesses.  (4) After the presentation of the evidence and closing argument, the trier of fact is to determine whether the defendant is mentally competent or mentally incompetent.    (A) If the matter is tried by a jury, the verdict must be unanimous.  (B) If the parties have waived the right to a jury trial, the court\u2019s findings must be made in writing or placed orally in the record.  (f) Posttrial procedure  (1)  If the defendant is found mentally competent, the court must reinstate the criminal proceedings.  (2)  If the defendant in a felony case is found to be mentally incompetent under section 1370 or the defendant in any criminal action is found to be mentally incompetent under section 1370.1 due to a developmental disability, the criminal proceedings remain suspended and the court either:  (A) Must issue an order committing the person for restoration treatment under the provisions of the governing statute; or   (B) In the case of a person eligible for commitment under sections 1370, if the person is found incompetent due to a mental disorder, may consider placing the person on a program of diversion under section 1001.36 in lieu of commitment.  (3) If the defendant is found to be mentally incompetent in a misdemeanor case under section 1370.01, the criminal proceedings remain suspended, and the court may dismiss the case under section 1385 or conduct a hearing to consider placing the person on a program of diversion under section 1001.36  (Subd (f) amended effective May 13, 2022; previously amended effective January 1, 2020.)  (g) Reinstatement of felony proceedings under section 1001.36(d)  If a defendant eligible for commitment under section 1370 is granted diversion under section 1001.36, and during the period of diversion, the court determines that criminal proceedings should be reinstated under section 1001.36(d), the court must, under section 1369, appoint a psychiatrist, licensed psychologist, or any other expert the court may deem appropriate, to examine the defendant and return a report opining on the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. The expert\u2019s report must be provided to counsel for the People and to the defendant\u2019s counsel.  29  (1) On receipt of the evaluation report, the court must conduct an inquiry into the defendant\u2019s current competency, under the procedures set forth in (h)(2) of this rule.  (2) If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is mentally competent, the court must hold a hearing as set forth in Penal Code section 1001.36(d).  (3) If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is mentally incompetent, criminal proceedings must remain suspended, and the court must order that the defendant be committed and placed for restoration treatment.  (4) If the court concludes, based on substantial evidence, that the defendant is mentally incompetent and is not likely to attain competency within the time remaining before the defendant\u2019s maximum date for returning to court, and has reason to believe the defendant may be gravely disabled, within the meaning of Welfare and Institutions Code section 5008(h)(1), the court may, instead of issuing a commitment order under section 1370, refer the matter to the conservatorship investigator of the county of commitment to initiate conservatorship proceedings for the defendant under Welfare and Institutions Code section 5350 et seq.  (Subd (g) amended effective May 13, 2022; adopted effective January 1, 2020; previously amended effective September 1, 2020.)  (h) Posttrial hearings on competence under section 1370  (1) If, at any time after the court has declared a defendant incompetent to stand trial, and counsel for the defendant, or a jail medical or mental health staff provider, provides the court with substantial evidence that the defendant\u2019s psychiatric symptoms have changed to such a degree as to create a doubt in the mind of the judge as to the defendant\u2019s current mental incompetence, the court may appoint a psychiatrist or a licensed psychologist to examine the defendant and, in an examination with the court, opine as to whether the defendant has regained competence.   (2) On receipt of an evaluation report under (h)(1) or an evaluation by the State Department of State Hospitals under Welfare and Institutions Code section 4335.2, the court must direct the clerk to serve a copy on counsel for the People and counsel for the defendant. If, in the opinion of the appointed expert or the department\u2019s expert, the defendant has regained competence, the court must conduct a hearing, as if a certificate of restoration of competence had been filed under section 1372(a)(1), except that a presumption of competency does not apply. At the hearing, the court may  30 consider any evidence, presented by any party, that is relevant to the question of the defendant\u2019s current mental competency.  (A) At the conclusion of the hearing, if the court finds that it has been established by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is mentally competent, the court must reinstate criminal proceedings.  (B)  At the conclusion of the hearing, if the court finds that it has not been established by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is mentally competent, criminal proceedings must remain suspended.  (C) The court\u2019s findings on the defendant\u2019s mental competency must be stated on the record and recorded in the minutes.  (Subd (h) amended effective May 13, 2022; adopted effective January 1, 2020.)  Rule 4.130 amended effective May 13, 2022; adopted effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2018, January 1, 2020, and September 1, 2020.  Advisory Committee Comment  The case law interpreting Penal Code section 1367 et seq. established a procedure for judges to follow in cases where there is a concern whether the defendant is legally competent to stand trial, but the concern does not necessarily rise to the level of a reasonable doubt based on substantial evidence. Before finding a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial and initiating competency proceedings under Penal Code section 1368 et seq., the court may appoint an expert to assist the court in determining whether such a reasonable doubt exists. As noted in People v. Visciotti  (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1, 34\u201336, the court may appoint an expert when it is concerned about the mental competency of the defendant, but the concern does not rise to the level of a reasonable doubt, based on substantial evidence, required by Penal Code section 1367 et seq. Should the results of this examination present substantial evidence of mental incompetency, the court must initiate competency proceedings under (b).

{"prompt": "circumstances is the court obligated to appoint more than two experts. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1369(a).) The costs of the experts appointed under (d) are to be paid for by the court as the expert examinations and reports are for the benefit or use of the court in determining whether the defendant is mentally incompetent. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.810, function 10.)  Subdivision (d)(3), which provides that the defendant\u2019s statements made during the examination cannot be used in a trial on the defendant\u2019s guilt or a sanity trial in a not guilty by reason of sanity trial, is based on the California Supreme Court holdings in People v. Arcega  (1982) 32 Cal.3d 504 and People v. Weaver  (2001) 26 Cal.4th 876.  Although the court is not obligated to appoint additional experts, counsel may nonetheless retain their own experts to testify at a trial on the defendant\u2019s competency. (See People v. Mayes  (1988) 202 Cal.App.4th 908, 917\u2013918.) These experts are not for the benefit or use of the court, and their costs are not to be paid by the court. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.810, function 10.)  31  Both the prosecution and the defense have the right to a jury trial. (See People v. Superior Court (McPeters)  (1995) 169 Cal.App.3d 796.) Defense counsel may waive this right, even over the objection of the defendant. ( People v. Masterson  (1994) 8 Cal.4th 965, 970.)   Either defense counsel or the prosecution (or both) may argue that the defendant is not competent to stand trial. ( People v. Stanley  (1995) 10 Cal.4th 764, 804 [defense counsel may advocate that defendant is not competent to stand trial and may present evidence of defendant\u2019s mental incompetency regardless of defendant\u2019s desire to be found competent].) If the defense declines to present evidence of the defendant\u2019s mental incompetency, the prosecution may do so. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1369(b)(2).) If the prosecution elects to present evidence of the defendant\u2019s mental incompetency, it is the prosecution\u2019s burden to prove the incompetency by a preponderance of the evidence. ( People v. Mixon  (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 1471, 1484, fn. 12.)  Should both parties decline to present evidence of defendant\u2019s mental incompetency, the court may do so. In those cases, the court is not to instruct the jury that a party has the burden of proof. \u201cRather, the proper approach would be to instruct the jury on the legal standard they are to apply to the evidence before them without allocating the burden of proof to one party or the other.\u201d (People v. Sherik  (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 444, 459\u2013460.)  Rule 4.131.  Probable cause determinations under section 1368.1(a)(2)   (a) Notice of a request for a determination of probable cause   The prosecuting attorney must serve and file notice of a request for a determination of probable cause on the defense at least 10 court days before the time appointed for the proceeding.   (b) Judge requirement  A judge must hear the determination of probable cause unless there is a stipulation by both parties to having the matter heard by a subordinate judicial officer.   (c) Defendant need not be present   A defendant need not be present for a determination of probable cause  to proceed.  (d) Application of section 861   The one-session requirement of section 861 does not apply.   (e) Transcript   A transcript of the determination of probable cause must be provided to the prosecuting attorney and counsel for the defendant  consistent with the manner in which a transcript is provided in a preliminary examination.

(Subd (a) adopted effective January 1, 2006.)  (b) General provisions   When a change of venue has been ordered, the case remains a case of the transferring court. Except on good cause to the contrary, the court must follow the provisions below:  (1) Proceedings before trial must be heard in the transferring court.  (2) Proceedings that are not to be heard by the trial judge must be heard in the transferring court.  (3) Postverdict proceedings, including sentencing, if any, must be heard in the transferring court.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted effective January 1, 2006.)  (c) Appellate review  Review by the Court of Appeal, either by an original proceeding or by appeal, must be heard in the appellate district in which the transferring court is located.  (Subd (c) adopted effective January 1, 2006.)   33 Rule 4.150 amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as rule 840 effective March 4, 1972; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2006.  Advisory Committee Comment   Subdivision (b)(1).  This subdivision is based on Penal Code section 1033(a), which provides that all proceedings before trial are to be heard in the transferring court, except when a particular proceeding must be heard by the trial judge.  Subdivision (b)(2).  This subdivision addresses motions heard by a judge other than the trial judge, such as requests for funds under Penal Code section 987.9 or a challenge or disqualification under Code of Civil Procedure section 170 et seq.  Subdivision (b)(3).  Reflecting the local community interest in the case, (b)(3) clarifies that after trial the case is to return to the transferring court for any posttrial proceedings. There may be situations where the local interest is outweighed, warranting the receiving court to conduct posttrial hearings. Such hearings may include motions for new trial where juror testimony is necessary and the convenience to the jurors outweighs the desire to conduct the hearings in the transferring court.  Subdivision (c).  This subdivision ensures that posttrial appeals and writs are heard in the same appellate district as any writs that may have been heard before or during trial.  Rule 4.151.  Motion for change of venue  (a) Motion procedure   A motion for change of venue in a criminal case under Penal Code section 1033 must be supported by a declaration stating the facts supporting the application. Except for good cause shown, the motion must be filed at least 10 days before the date set for trial, with a copy served on the adverse party at least 10 days before the hearing. At the hearing counterdeclarations may be filed.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted effective January 1, 2006; formerly part of an unlettered subd.)  (b) Policy considerations in ruling on motion  Before ordering a change of venue in a criminal case, the transferring court should consider impaneling a jury that would give the defendant a fair and impartial trial.  (Subd (b) adopted effective January 1, 2006.)  Rule 4.151 amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as rule 841 effective March 4, 1972; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2006.  Advisory Committee Comment   34  Rule 4.151(b) is not intended to imply that the court should attempt to impanel a jury in every case before granting a change of venue.  Rule 4.152.  Selection of court and trial judge  When a judge grants a motion for change of venue, he or she must inform the presiding judge of the transferring court. The presiding judge, or his or her designee, must:  (1) Notify the Administrative Director of the change of venue. After receiving the transferring court\u2019s notification, the Administrative Director, in order to expedite judicial business and equalize the work of the judges, must advise the transferring court which courts would not be unduly burdened by the trial of the case.   (2) Select the judge to try the case, as follows:  (A) The presiding judge, or his or her designee, must select a judge from the transferring court, unless he or she concludes that the transferring court does not have adequate judicial resources to try the case.  (B) If the presiding judge, or his or her designee, concludes that the transferring court does not have adequate judicial resources to try the case, he or she must request that the Chief Justice of California determine whether to assign a judge to the transferring court. If the Chief Justice determines not to assign a judge to the transferring court, the presiding judge, or his or her designee, must select a judge from the transferring court to try the case.  Rule 4.152 amended effective January 1, 2016; adopted as rule 842 effective March 4, 1972; previously amended and renumbered as rule 4.152 effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2006.   Rule 4.153.  Order on change of venue  After receiving the list of courts from the Administrative Director, the presiding judge, or his or her designee, must:  (1) Determine the court in which the case is to be tried. In making that determination, the court must consider, under Penal Code section 1036.7, whether to move the jury rather than to move the pending action. In so doing, the court should give particular consideration to the convenience of the jurors.  (2) Transmit to the receiving court a certified copy of the order of transfer and any pleadings, documents, or other papers or exhibits necessary for trying the case.  (3) Enter the order for change of venue in the minutes of the transferring court. The order must include the determinations in (1).  35  Rule 4.153 amended effective January 1, 2016; adopted as rule 843 effective March 4, 1972; previously amended and renumbered as rule 4.153 effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2006.  Advisory Committee Comment   Rules 4.152 and 4.153 recognize that, although the determination of whether to grant a motion for change of venue is judicial in nature, the selection of the receiving court and the decision whether the case should be tried by a judge of the transferring court are more administrative in nature. Thus, the rules provide that the presiding judge of the transferring court is to make the latter decisions. He or she may delegate those decisions to the trial judge, the supervising judge of the criminal division, or any other judge the presiding judge deems appropriate. If, under the particular facts of the case, the latter decisions are both judicial and administrative, those decisions may be more properly made by the judge who heard the motion for change of venue.

Rule 4.154 amended effective January 1, 2006; adopted as rule 844 effective March 4, 1972; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2001.  Rule 4.155.  Guidelines for reimbursement of costs in change of venue cases\u2014criminal cases  (a) General  Consistent with Penal Code section 1037, the court in which an action originated must reimburse the court receiving a case after an order for change of venue for any ordinary expenditure and any extraordinary but reasonable and necessary expenditure that would not have been incurred by the receiving court but for the change of venue.  (Subd (a) amended effective September 1, 2017; previously amended effective January 1, 2001, and January 1, 2006.)  (b) Reimbursable ordinary expenditures\u2014court related  Court-related reimbursable ordinary expenses include:  (1) For prospective jurors on the panel from which the jury is selected and for the trial jurors and alternates seated:  36  (A) Normal juror per diem and mileage at the rates of the receiving court. The cost of the juror should only be charged to a change of venue case if the juror was not used in any other case on the day that juror was excused from the change of venue case.  (B) If jurors are sequestered, actual lodging, meals, mileage, and parking expenses up to state Board of Control limits.  (C) If jurors are transported to a different courthouse or county, actual mileage and parking expenses.  (2) For court reporters:  (A) The cost of pro tem reporters, even if not used on the change of venue trial, but not the salaries of regular official reporters who would have been paid in any event. The rate of compensation for pro tem reporters should be that of the receiving court.  (B) The cost of transcripts requested during trial and for any new trial or appeal, using the folio rate of the receiving court.  (C) The cost of additional reporters necessary to allow production of a daily or expedited transcript.  (3) For assigned judges: The assigned judge\u2019s per diem, travel, and other expenses, up to state Board of Control limits, if the judge is assigned to the receiving court because of the change of venue case, regardless of whether the assigned judge is hearing the change of venue case.  (4) For interpreters and translators:  (A) The cost of the services of interpreters and translators, not on the court staff, if those services are required under Evidence Code sections 750 through 754. Using the receiving court\u2019s fee schedule, this cost should be paid whether the services are used in a change of venue trial or to cover staff interpreters and translators assigned to the change of venue trial.  (B) Interpreters\u2019 and translators\u2019 actual mileage, per diem, and lodging expenses, if any, that were incurred in connection with the trial, up to state Board of Control limits.  (5) For maintenance of evidence: The cost of handling, storing, or maintaining evidence beyond the expenses normally incurred by the receiving court.   37 (6) For services and supplies: The cost of services and supplies incurred only because of the change of venue trial, for example, copying and printing charges (such as for juror questionnaires), long-distance telephone calls, and postage. A pro rata share of the costs of routine services and supplies should not be reimbursable.  (7) For court or county employees:  (A) Overtime expenditures and compensatory time for staff incurred because of the change of venue case.  (B) Salaries and benefit costs of extra help or temporary help incurred either because of the change of venue case or to replace staff assigned to the change of venue case.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 1998, and January 1, 2006.)  (c) Reimbursable ordinary expenses\u2014defendant related  Defendant-related reimbursable ordinary expenses include the actual costs incurred for guarding, keeping, and transporting the defendant, including:  (1) Expenses related to health care: Costs incurred by or on behalf of the defendant such as doctors, hospital expenses, medicines, therapists, and counseling for diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment.  (2) Cost of food and special clothing for an in-custody defendant.  (3) Transportation: Nonroutine expenses, such as transporting an in-custody defendant from the transferring court to the receiving court. Routine transportation expenses if defendant is transported by usual means used for other receiving court prisoners should not be reimbursable.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2006.)  (d) Reimbursable ordinary expenditures\u2014defense expenses  Reimbursable ordinary expenses related to providing defense for the defendant include:  (1) Matters covered by Penal Code section 987.9 as determined by the transferring court or by a judge designated under that section.  (2) Payment of other defense costs in accordance with policies of the court in which the action originated, unless good cause to the contrary is shown to the trial court.  38  (3) Unless Penal Code section 987.9 applies, the receiving court may, in its sound discretion, approve all trial-related expenses including:  (A) Attorney fees for defense counsel and, if any, co-counsel and actual travel-related expenses, up to state Board of Control limits, for staying in the county of the receiving court during trial and hearings.  (B) Paralegal and extraordinary secretarial or office expenditures of defense counsel.  (C) Expert witness costs and expenses.  (D) The cost of experts assisting in preparation before trial or during trial, for example, persons preparing demonstrative evidence.  (E) Investigator expenses.  (F) Defense witness expenses, including reasonable-and-necessary witness fees and travel expenses.  (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2006; previously amended effective January 1, 1998.)  (e) Extraordinary but reasonable-and-necessary expenses  Except in emergencies or unless it is impracticable to do so, a receiving court should give notice before incurring any extraordinary expenditures to the transferring court, in accordance with Penal Code section 1037(d). Extraordinary but reasonable-and-necessary expenditures include:  (1) Security-related expenditures: The cost of extra security precautions taken because of the risk of escape or suicide or threats of, or the potential for, violence during the trial. These precautions might include, for example, extra bailiffs or correctional officers, special transportation to the courthouse for trial, television monitoring, and security checks of those entering the courtroom.  (2) Facility remodeling or modification: Alterations to buildings or courtrooms to accommodate the change of venue case.  (3) Renting or leasing of space or equipment: Renting or leasing of space for courtrooms, offices, and other facilities, or equipment to accommodate the change of venue case.  (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2006; previously amended effective January 1, 1998.)  39  (f) Nonreimbursable expenses  Nonreimbursable expenses include:  (1) Normal operating expenses including the overhead of the receiving court, for example:  (A) Salary and benefits of existing court staff that would have been paid even if there were no change of venue case.  (B) The cost of operating the jail, for example, detention staff costs, normal inmate clothing, utility costs, overhead costs, and jail construction costs.  These expenditures would have been incurred whether or not the case was transferred to the receiving court. It is, therefore, inappropriate to seek reimbursement from the transferring court.  (2) Equipment that is purchased and then kept by the receiving court and that can be used for other purposes or cases.  (Subd (f) amended effective January 1, 2006.)  (g) Miscellaneous  (1) Documentation of costs: No expense should be submitted for reimbursement without supporting documentation, such as a claim, invoice, bill, statement, or time sheet. In unusual circumstances, a declaration under penalty of perjury may be necessary. The declaration should describe the cost and state that it was incurred because of the change of venue case. Any required court order or approval of costs also should be sent to the transferring court.  (2) Timing of reimbursement: Unless both courts agree to other terms, reimbursement of all expenses that are not questioned by the transferring court should be made within 60 days of receipt of the claim for reimbursement. Payment of disputed amounts should be made within 60 days of the resolution of the dispute.  (Subd (g) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2006.)

Rule 4.201 amended effective January 1, 2006; adopted as rule 228.2 effective June 6, 1990; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2001.  Advisory Committee Comment  Although Code of Civil Procedure section 223 creates a preference for nonsequestered voir dire (People v. Roldan  (2005) 35 Cal.4th 646, 691), a judge may conduct sequestered voir dire on questions concerning media reports of the case and on any other issue deemed advisable. (See, e.g., Cal. Stds. Jud. Admin., std. 4.30(a)(3).) To determine whether such issues are present, a judge may consider factors including the charges, the nature of the evidence that is anticipated to be presented, and any other relevant factors. To that end, a judge should always inform jurors of the possibility of sequestered voir dire if the voir dire is likely to elicit answers that the juror may believe are sensitive in nature. It should also be noted that when written questionnaires are used, jurors must be advised of the right to request a hearing in chambers on sensitive questions rather than answering them on the questionnaire.

Traffic court\u2014trial by written declaration  (a) Applicability   This rule establishes the minimum procedural requirements for trials by written declaration under Vehicle Code section 40902. The procedures established by this rule must be followed in all trials by written declaration under that section.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Procedure  (1) Definition of due date   As used in this subdivision, \u201cdue date\u201d means the last date on which the defendant\u2019s appearance is timely.  (2) Extending due date   If the clerk receives the defendant\u2019s written request for a trial by written declaration by the appearance date indicated on the Notice to Appear, the clerk must, within 15 calendar days after receiving the defendant\u2019s written request, extend the appearance date 25 calendar days and must give or mail notice to the defendant of the extended due date on the Request for Trial by Written Declaration (form TR-205) with a copy of the Instructions to Defendant (form TR-200) and any other required forms.  (3) Election  The defendant must file a Request for Trial by Written Declaration (form TR-205) with the clerk by the appearance date indicated on the Notice to Appear or the extended due date as provided in (2). The Request for Trial by Written Declaration (form TR-205) must be filed in addition to the defendant\u2019s written request for a trial by written declaration, unless the defendant\u2019s request was made on the election form.  (4) Bail  The defendant must deposit bail with the clerk by the appearance date indicated on the Notice to Appear  or the extended due date as provided in (2).  (5) Instructions to arresting officer   If the clerk receives the defendant\u2019s Request for Trial by Written Declaration  (form TR-205) and bail by the due date, the clerk must deliver or mail to the arresting officer\u2019s agency Notice and Instructions to Arresting Officer (form TR-210) and  Officer\u2019s Declaration  (form TR-235) with a copy of the Notice  43 to Appear and a specified return date for receiving the officer\u2019s declaration. After receipt of the officer\u2019s declaration, or at the close of the officer\u2019s return date if no officer\u2019s declaration is filed, the clerk must submit the case file with all declarations and other evidence received to the court for decision.  (6) Court decision   After the court decides the case and returns the file and decision, the clerk must immediately deliver or mail the Decision and Notice of Decision (form TR-215) to the defendant and the arresting agency.  (7) Trial de novo   If the defendant files a Request for New Trial (Trial de Novo) (form TR-220) within 20 calendar days after the date of delivery or mailing of the Decision and Notice of Decision (form TR-215), the clerk must set a trial date within 45 calendar days of receipt of the defendant\u2019s written request for a new trial. The clerk must deliver or mail to the defendant and to the arresting officer\u2019s agency the Order and Notice to Defendant of New Trial (Trial de Novo)  (form TR-225). If the defendant\u2019s request is not timely received, no new trial may be held and the case must be closed.  (8) Case and time standard   The clerk must deliver or mail the Decision and Notice of Decision (form TR-215) within 90 calendar days after the due date. Acts for which no specific time is stated in this rule must be performed promptly so that the Decision and Notice of Decision can be timely delivered or mailed by the clerk. Failure of the clerk or the court to comply with any time limit does not void or invalidate the decision of the court, unless prejudice to the defendant is shown.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2000, and July 1, 2000.)  (c) Due dates and time limits  Due dates and time limits must be as stated in this rule, unless changed or extended by the court. The court may extend any date, but the court need not state the reasons for granting or denying an extension on the record or in the minutes.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (d) Ineligible defendants  If the defendant requests a trial by written declaration and the clerk or the court determines that the defendant is not eligible for a trial by written declaration, the  44 clerk must extend the due date 25 calendar days and notify the defendant by mail of the determination and due date. (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (e) Noncompliance  If the defendant does not comply with this rule (including submitting the required bail amount, signing and filing all required forms, and complying with all time limits and due dates), the court may deny a trial by written declaration and may proceed as otherwise provided by statute and court rules.  (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (f) Evidence  Testimony and other relevant evidence may be introduced in the form of a Notice to Appear issued under Vehicle Code section 40500; a business record or receipt; a sworn declaration of the arresting officer; and, on behalf of the defendant, a sworn declaration of the defendant.  (Subd (f) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (g) Fines, assessments, or penalties  The statute and the rules do not prevent or preclude the court from imposing on a defendant who is found guilty any lawful fine, assessment, or other penalty, and the court is not limited to imposing money penalties in the bail amount, unless the bail amount is the maximum and the only lawful penalty.  (Subd (g) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (h) Additional forms and procedures  The clerk may approve and prescribe forms, time limits, and procedures that are not in conflict with or not inconsistent with the statute or this rule.

Rule 4.405.  Definitions  As used in this division, unless the context otherwise requires:  (1) \u201cThese rules\u201d means the rules in this division.  (2) \u201cBase term\u201d is the determinate or indeterminate sentence imposed for the commission of a crime, not including any enhancements that carry an additional term of imprisonment.  (3) When a person is convicted of two or more felonies, the \u201cprincipal term\u201d is the greatest determinate term of imprisonment imposed by the court for any of the crimes, including any term imposed for applicable count-specific enhancements.   (4) When a person is convicted of two or more felonies, the \u201csubordinate term\u201d is the determinate term imposed for an offense, plus any count-specific enhancements applicable to the offense ordered to run consecutively to the principal term.  55  (5) \u201cEnhancement\u201d means an additional term of imprisonment added to the base term.  (6) \u201cOffense\u201d means the offense of conviction unless a different meaning is specified or is otherwise clear from the context. The term \u201cinstant\u201d or \u201ccurrent\u201d is used in connection with \u201coffense\u201d or \u201coffense of conviction\u201d to distinguish the violation for which the defendant is being sentenced from an enhancement, prior or subsequent offense, or from an offense before another court.  (7) \u201cAggravation,\u201d or \u201ccircumstances in aggravation means factors that justify the imposition of the upper prison term referred to in section 1170(b) and 1170.1, or factors that the court may consider in exercising discretion authorized by statute and under these rules including imposing the middle term instead of a low term, denying probation, ordering consecutive sentences, or determining whether to exercise discretion pursuant to section 1385(c).

Rule 4.405 amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted as rule 405 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective July 28, 1977, January 1, 1991, July 1, 2003, January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, January 1, 2017, and January 1, 2018.  Advisory Committee Comment  The Legislature amended the determinate sentencing law to require courts to order imposition of a sentence or enhancement not to exceed the middle term unless factors in aggravation justify imposition of the upper term and are stipulated to by the defendant or found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by the jury or by the judge in a court trial. (See Sen. Bill 567; Stats. 2021, ch. 731.) However, in determining whether to impose the upper term for a criminal offense, the court may consider as an aggravating factor that a defendant has suffered one or more prior convictions, based on certified records of conviction. This exception may not be used to select the upper term of an enhancement.  The court may exercise its judicial discretion in imposing the middle term or low term and must state the facts and reasons on the record for choosing the sentence imposed. In exercising this discretion between the middle term and the low term, the court may rely on aggravating factors that have not been stipulated to by the defendant or proven beyond a reasonable doubt. ( People v. Black (2007) 41 Cal.4th 799.)  \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": "imposition of the low term when the court finds that certain factors contributed to the commission of the crime unless the court finds that it would not be in the interests of justice to do so because the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170(b)(6).)   Rule 4.406.  Reasons  (a) How given   If the sentencing judge is required to give reasons for a sentence choice, the judge must state in simple language the primary factor or factors that support the exercise of discretion. The statement need not be in the language of the statute or these rules. It must be delivered orally on the record. The court may give a single statement explaining the reason or reasons for imposing a particular sentence or the exercise of judicial discretion, if the statement identifies the sentencing choices where discretion is exercised and there is no impermissible dual use of facts.  57  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) When reasons required  Sentence choices that generally require a statement of a reason include, but are not limited to:  (1) Granting probation when the defendant is presumptively ineligible for probation;  (2) Denying probation when the defendant is presumptively eligible for probation;  (3) Selecting a term for either an offense or an enhancement;  (4) Imposing consecutive sentences;  (5) Imposing full consecutive sentences under section 667.6(c) rather than consecutive terms under section 1170.1(a), when the court has that choice;  (6) Waiving a restitution fine;  (7) Granting relief under section 1385; and  (8) Denying mandatory supervision in the interests of justice under section 1170(h)(5)(A).  (Subd (b) amended and renumbered effective March 14, 2022; previously amended effective January 1, 2001, July 1, 2003, January 1, 2006, January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, and January 1, 2017; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2018.)  Rule 4.406 amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted as rule 406 effective January 1, 1991; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective July 1, 2003, January 1, 2006, January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, January 1, 2017, and January 1, 2018.   Advisory Committee Comment  This rule is not intended to expand the statutory requirements for giving reasons, and is not an independent interpretation of the statutory requirements.  The court is not required to separately state the reasons for making each sentencing choice so long as the record reflects the court understood it had discretion on a particular issue and its reasons for making the particular choice. For example, if the court decides to deny probation and  58 impose the upper term of punishment, the court may simply state: \u201cI am denying probation and imposing the upper term because of the extensive losses to the victim and because the defendant\u2019s record is increasing in seriousness.\u201d It is not necessary to state a reason after exercising each decision.  The court must be mindful of impermissible dual use of facts in stating reasons for sentencing choices. For example, the court is not permitted to use a reason to impose a greater term if that reason also is either (1) the same as an enhancement that will be imposed, or (2) an element of the crime. The court should not use the same reason to impose a consecutive sentence and to impose an upper term of imprisonment. ( People v. Avalos  (1984) 37 Cal.3d 216, 233.) It is not improper to use the same reason to deny probation and to impose the upper term. ( People v. Bowen  (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 102, 106.)  Whenever relief is granted under section 1385, the court\u2019s reasons for exercising that discretion must be stated orally on the record and entered in the minutes if requested by a party or if the proceedings are not recorded electronically or reported by a court reporter. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1385(a).) Although no legal authority requires the court to state reasons for denying relief, such a statement may be helpful in the appellate review of the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion.   Rule 4.408.  Listing of factors not exclusive; sequence not significant  (a) The listing of factors in these rules for making discretionary sentencing decisions is not exhaustive and does not prohibit a trial judge from using additional criteria reasonably related to the decision being made. Any such additional criteria must be stated on the record by the sentencing judge.   (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) The order in which criteria are listed does not indicate their relative weight or importance.   Rule 4.408 amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted as rule 408 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.  Advisory Committee Comment  The variety of circumstances presented in felony cases is so great that no listing of criteria could claim to be all-inclusive. (Cf., Evid. Code, \u00a7 351.)  The court may impose a sentence or enhancement exceeding the middle term only if the facts underlying the aggravating factor were stipulated to by the defendant or found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by the jury or by the judge in a court trial. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170(b)(2).)  However, in determining whether to impose the upper term for a criminal offense, the court may consider as an aggravating factor that a defendant has suffered one or more prior convictions, based on certified records of conviction. This exception may not be used to select the upper term of an enhancement. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170(b)(3).)  59  The Legislature also amended the determinate sentencing law to require courts to order imposition of the low term when the court finds that certain factors contributed to the commission of the crime unless the court finds that it would not be in the interests of justice to do so because the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170(b)(6).)    Rule 4.409. Consideration of relevant factors  Relevant factors enumerated in these rules must be considered by the sentencing judge, and will be deemed to have been considered unless the record affirmatively reflects otherwise.  Rule 4.409 amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted as rule 409 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.  Advisory Committee Comment  Relevant factors are those applicable to the facts in the record of the case; not all factors will be relevant to each case. The judge\u2019s duty is similar to the duty to consider the probation officer\u2019s report. Section 1203.  In deeming the sentencing judge to have considered relevant factors, the rule applies the presumption of Evidence Code section 664 that official duty has been regularly performed. (See People v. Moran  (1970) 1 Cal.3d 755, 762 [trial court presumed to have considered referring eligible defendant to California Youth Authority in absence of any showing to the contrary, citing Evidence Code section 664].)  Rule 4.410.  General objectives in sentencing  (a) General objectives of sentencing include:  (1) Protecting society;  (2) Punishing the defendant;  (3) Encouraging the defendant to lead a law-abiding life in the future and deterring him or her from future offenses;  (4) Deterring others from criminal conduct by demonstrating its consequences;  (5) Preventing the defendant from committing new crimes by isolating him or her for the period of incarceration;  (6) Securing restitution for the victims of crime;   (7) Achieving uniformity in sentencing; and  60  (8) Increasing public safety by reducing recidivism through community-based corrections programs and evidence-based practices.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2017; previously amended effective July 1, 2003, ad January 1, 2007.)  (b) Because in some instances these objectives may suggest inconsistent dispositions, the sentencing judge must consider which objectives are of primary importance in the particular case. The sentencing judge should be guided by statutory statements of policy, the criteria in these rules, and any other facts and circumstances relevant to the case.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously lettered effective July 1, 2003; adopted as part of unlettered subd effective July 1, 1977; former subd (b) amended and relettered as part of subd (a) effective July 1, 2003.)  Rule 4.410 amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted as rule 410 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective July 1, 2003, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2017.  Advisory Committee Comment  Statutory expressions of policy include:  Section 1170(a)(1), which expresses the policies of uniformity, proportionality of terms of imprisonment to the seriousness of the offense, and the use of imprisonment as punishment. It also states that \u201cthe purpose of sentencing is public safety achieved through punishment, rehabilitation, and restorative justice.\u201d  Sections 17.5, 1228, and 3450, which express the policies promoting reinvestment of criminal justice resources to support community-based corrections programs and evidence-based practices to improve public safety through a reduction in recidivism.   Rule 4.411.  Presentence investigations and reports  (a) When required  As provided in subdivision (b), the court must refer the case to the probation officer for:  (1) A presentence investigation and report if the defendant:  (A) Is statutorily eligible for probation or a term of imprisonment in county jail under section 1170(h); or   61 (B) Is not eligible for probation but a report is needed to assist the court with other sentencing issues, including the determination of the proper amount of restitution fine;  (2) A supplemental report if a significant period of time has passed since the original report was prepared.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective January 1, 2007, and January 15, 2015.)  (b) Waiver of the investigation and report  The parties may stipulate to the waiver of the probation officer\u2019s investigation and report in writing or in open court and entered in the minutes, and with the consent of the court. In deciding whether to consent to the waiver, the court should consider whether the information in the report would assist in the resolution of any current or future sentencing issues, or would assist in the effective supervision of the person. A waiver under this section does not affect the requirement under section 1203c that a probation report be created when the court commits a person to state prison.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective January 1, 2015.)  Rule 4.411 amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted as rule 418 effective July 1, 1977; previously amended and renumbered as rule 411 effective January 1, 1991; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2006, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2015.  Advisory Committee Comment  Section 1203 requires a presentence report in every felony case in which the defendant is eligible for probation. Subdivision (a) requires a presentence report in every felony case in which the defendant is eligible for a term of imprisonment in county jail under section 1170(h).  When considering whether to waive a presentence investigation and report, courts should \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": "of imprisonment in prison or county jail under section 1170(h); (2) courts in deciding whether probation is appropriate, whether a period of mandatory supervision should be denied in the interests of justice under section 1170(h)(5)(A), and the appropriate length and conditions of probation and mandatory supervision; (3) the probation department in supervising the defendant; and (4) the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Adult Operations, in deciding on the type of facility and program in which to place a defendant.  Subdivision (a)(2) is based on case law that generally requires a supplemental report if the defendant is to be resentenced a significant time after the original sentencing, as, for example, after a remand by an appellate court, or after the apprehension of a defendant who failed to appear at sentencing. The rule is not intended to expand on the requirements of those cases.   62 The rule does not require a new investigation and report if a recent report is available and can be incorporated by reference and there is no indication of changed circumstances. This is particularly true if a report is needed only for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation because the defendant has waived a report and agreed to a prison sentence. If a full report was prepared in another case in the same or another jurisdiction within the preceding six months, during which time the defendant was in custody, and that report is available to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, it is unlikely that a new investigation is needed.  This rule does not prohibit pre-conviction, pre-plea reports as authorized by section 1203.7.  Rule 4.411.5.  Probation officer\u2019s presentence investigation report  (a) Contents  A probation officer\u2019s presentence investigation report in a felony case must include at least the following:  (1) A face sheet showing at least:  (A) The defendant\u2019s name and other identifying data;  (B) The case number;  (C) The crime of which the defendant was convicted, and any enhancements which were admitted or found true;  (D) Any factors in aggravation including whether the factors were stipulated to by the defendant, found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by a jury, or found true beyond a reasonable doubt by a judge in a court trial;    (E) The date of commission of the crime, the date of conviction, and any other dates relevant to sentencing;  (F) The defendant\u2019s custody status; and  (G) The terms of any agreement on which a plea of guilty was based.  (2) The facts and circumstances of the crime and the defendant\u2019s arrest, including information concerning any co-defendants and the status or disposition of their cases. The source of all such information must be stated.  (3) A summary of the defendant\u2019s record of prior criminal conduct, including convictions as an adult and sustained petitions in juvenile delinquency proceedings. Records of an arrest or charge not leading to a conviction or the  63 sustaining of a petition may not be included unless supported by facts concerning the arrest or charge.  (4) Any statement made by the defendant to the probation officer, or a summary thereof, including the defendant\u2019s account of the circumstances of the crime.  (5) Information concerning the victim of the crime, including:  (A) The victim\u2019s statement or a summary thereof, if available;  (B) Any physical or psychological injuries suffered by the victim;  (C) The amount of the victim\u2019s monetary loss, and whether or not it is covered by insurance; and  (D) Any information required by law.  (6) Any relevant facts concerning the defendant\u2019s social history, including those categories enumerated in section 1203.10, organized under appropriate subheadings, including, whenever applicable, \u201cFamily,\u201d \u201cEducation,\u201d \u201cEmployment and income,\u201d \u201cMilitary,\u201d \u201cMedical/psychological,\u201d \u201cRecord of substance abuse or lack thereof,\u201d and any other relevant subheadings. This includes:  (A) Facts relevant to whether the defendant may be suffering from sexual trauma, traumatic brain injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or mental health problems as a result of his or her U.S. military service; and   (B) Factors listed in section 1170(b)(6) and whether the current offense is connected to those factors.   (7) Collateral information, including written statements from:  (A) Official sources such as defense and prosecuting attorneys, police (subsequent to any police reports used to summarize the crime), probation and parole officers who have had prior experience with the defendant, and correctional personnel who observed the defendant\u2019s behavior during any period of presentence incarceration; and  (B) Interested persons, including family members and others who have written letters concerning the defendant.  (8) The defendant\u2019s relevant risk factors and needs as identified by a risk/needs assessment, if such an assessment is performed, and such other information from the assessment as may be requested by the court.  64  (9) An evaluation of factors relating to disposition. This section must include:  (A) A reasoned discussion of the defendant's suitability and eligibility for probation, and, if probation is recommended, a proposed plan including recommendations for the conditions of probation and any special need for supervision;   (B) If a prison sentence or term of imprisonment in county jail under section 1170(h) is recommended or is likely to be imposed, a reasoned discussion of aggravating and mitigating factors affecting the sentence length;   (C) If denial of a period of mandatory supervision in the interests of justice is recommended, a reasoned discussion of the factors prescribed by rule 4.415(b);   (D) If a term of imprisonment in county jail under section 1170(h) is recommended, a reasoned discussion of the defendant\u2019s suitability for specific terms and length of period of mandatory supervision, including the factors prescribed by rule 4.415(c); and  (E) A reasoned discussion of the defendant\u2019s ability to make restitution, pay any fine or penalty that may be recommended, or satisfy any special conditions of probation that are proposed.    Discussions of factors (A) through (D) must refer to any sentencing rule directly relevant to the facts of the case, but no rule may be cited without a reasoned discussion of its relevance and relative importance.   (10)  Any mitigating factors pursuant to section 1385(c).  (11) The probation officer's recommendation. When requested by the sentencing judge or by standing instructions to the probation department, the report must include recommendations concerning the length of any prison or county jail term under section 1170(h) that may be imposed, including the base term, the imposition of concurrent or consecutive sentences, and the imposition or striking of the additional terms for enhancements charged and found.  (12) Detailed information on presentence time spent by the defendant in custody, including the beginning and ending dates of the period or periods of custody; the existence of any other sentences imposed on the defendant during the period of custody; the amount of good behavior, work, or participation credit to which the defendant is entitled; and whether the sheriff or other officer holding custody, the prosecution, or the defense wishes that a hearing be held for the purposes of denying good behavior, work, or participation credit.  65  (13) A statement of mandatory and recommended restitution, restitution fines, and other fines, fees, assessments, penalties, and costs to be assessed against the defendant; a recommendation whether any restitution order should become a judgment under section 1203(j) if unpaid; and, when appropriate, any finding concerning the defendant\u2019s ability to pay.   (14) Information pursuant to section 29810(c):  (A) Whether the defendant has properly complied with Penal Code section 29810 by relinquishing firearms identified by the probation officer\u2019s investigation or declared by the defendant on the Prohibited Persons Relinquishment Form, and  (B) Whether the defendant has timely submitted a completed Prohibited Persons Relinquishment Form.

Rule 4.412.  Reasons\u2014agreement to punishment as an adequate reason and as abandonment of certain claims   66 (a) Defendant\u2019s agreement as reason   It is an adequate reason for a sentence or other disposition that the defendant, personally and by counsel, has expressed agreement that it be imposed and the prosecuting attorney has not expressed an objection to it. The agreement and lack of objection must be recited on the record. This section does not authorize a sentence that is not otherwise authorized by law.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2001.)  (b) Agreement to sentence abandons section 654 claim  By agreeing to a specified term in prison or county jail under section 1170(h) personally and by counsel, a defendant who is sentenced to that term or a shorter one abandons any claim that a component of the sentence violates section 654\u2019s prohibition of double punishment, unless that claim is asserted at the time the agreement is recited on the record.

Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivision (a). This subdivision is intended to relieve the court of an obligation to give reasons if the sentence or other disposition is one that the defendant has accepted and to which the prosecutor expresses no objection. The judge may choose to give reasons for the sentence even though not obligated to do so.  Judges should also be aware that there may be statutory limitations on \u201cplea bargaining\u201d or on the entry of a guilty plea on the condition that no more than a particular sentence will be imposed. Such limitations appear, for example, in sections 1192.5 and 1192.7.  Subdivision (b). This subdivision is based on the fact that a defendant who, with the advice of counsel, expresses agreement to a specified term of imprisonment normally is acknowledging that the term is appropriate for his or her total course of conduct. This subdivision applies to both determinate and indeterminate terms.   Rule 4.413.

(b) Probation in cases when defendant is presumptively ineligible  If the defendant comes under a statutory provision prohibiting probation \u201cexcept in unusual cases where the interests of justice would best be served,\u201d or a substantially equivalent provision, the court should apply the criteria in (c) to evaluate whether the statutory limitation on probation is overcome; and if it is, the court should then apply the criteria in rule 4.414 to decide whether to grant probation.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective July 1, 2003, and January 1, 2007.)  (c) Factors overcoming the presumption of ineligibility  The following factors may indicate the existence of an unusual case in which probation may be granted if otherwise appropriate:  Factors relating to basis for limitation on probation:  (1) A factor or circumstance indicating that the basis for the statutory limitation on probation, although technically present, is not fully applicable to the case, including:  (A) The factor or circumstance giving rise to the limitation on probation is, in this case, substantially less serious than the circumstances typically present in other cases involving the same probation limitation, and the defendant has no recent record of committing similar crimes or crimes of violence; and  (B) The current offense is less serious than a prior felony conviction that is the cause of the limitation on probation, and the defendant has been free from incarceration and serious violation of the law for a substantial time before the current offense.  (2) Factors limiting defendant\u2019s culpability   A factor or circumstance not amounting to a defense, but reducing the defendant\u2019s culpability for the offense, including:   68 (A) The defendant participated in the crime under circumstances of great provocation, coercion, or duress not amounting to a defense, and the defendant has no recent record of committing crimes of violence;  (B) The crime was committed because of a mental condition not amounting to a defense, and there is a high likelihood that the defendant would respond favorably to mental health care and treatment that would be required as a condition of probation; and  (C) The defendant is youthful or aged, and has no significant record of prior criminal offenses.  (3) Results of risk/needs assessment   Along with all other relevant information in the case, the court may consider the results of a risk/needs assessment of the defendant, if one was performed. The weight of a risk/needs assessment is for the court to consider in its sentencing discretion.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)

(b) Facts relating to the defendant  Facts relating to the defendant include:  (1) Prior record of criminal conduct, whether as an adult or a juvenile, including the recency and frequency of prior crimes; and whether the prior record indicates a pattern of regular or increasingly serious criminal conduct;  (2) Prior performance and present status on probation, mandatory supervision, postrelease community supervision, or parole;  (3) Willingness to comply with the terms of probation;  (4) Ability to comply with reasonable terms of probation as indicated by the defendant\u2019s age, education, health, mental faculties, history of alcohol or other substance abuse, family background and ties, employment and military service history, and other relevant factors;  (5) The likely effect of imprisonment on the defendant and his or her dependents;  (6) The adverse collateral consequences on the defendant\u2019s life resulting from the felony conviction;  (7) Whether the defendant is remorseful; and  (8) The likelihood that if not imprisoned the defendant will be a danger to others.   70 (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2017; previously amended effective January 1, 1991, July 1, 2003, and January 1, 2007.)  (c)  Suitability for probation  In determining the suitability of the defendant for probation, the court may consider factors in aggravation and mitigation, whether or not the factors have been stipulated to by the defendant or found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by a jury or the judge in a court trial.  (Subd (c) adopted effective March 14, 2022.)  Rule 4.414 amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted as rule 414 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 1991, July 1, 2003, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2017  Advisory Committee Comment  The sentencing judge\u2019s discretion to grant probation is unaffected by the Uniform Determinate Sentencing Act (section 1170(a)(3)).  The decision whether to grant probation is normally based on an overall evaluation of the likelihood that the defendant will live successfully in the general community. Each criterion points to evidence that the likelihood of success is great or small. A single criterion will rarely be determinative; in most cases, the sentencing judge will have to balance favorable and unfavorable facts.  Under criteria (b)(3) and (b)(4), it is appropriate to consider the defendant\u2019s expressions of willingness to comply and his or her apparent sincerity, and whether the defendant\u2019s home and work environment and primary associates will be supportive of the defendant\u2019s efforts to comply with the terms of probation, among other factors.  Rule 4.415.  Criteria affecting the imposition of mandatory supervision  (a) Presumption  Except where the defendant is statutorily ineligible for suspension of any part of the sentence, when imposing a term of imprisonment in county jail under section 1170(h), the court must suspend execution of a concluding portion of the term to be served as a period of mandatory supervision unless the court finds, in the interests of justice, that mandatory supervision is not appropriate in a particular case. Because section 1170(h)(5)(A) establishes a statutory presumption in favor of the imposition of a period of mandatory supervision in all applicable cases, denials of a period of mandatory supervision should be limited.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2017.)   71 (b) Criteria for denying mandatory supervision in the interests of justice  In determining that mandatory supervision is not appropriate in the interests of justice under section 1170(h)(5)(A), the court\u2019s determination must be based on factors that are specific to a particular case or defendant. Factors the court may consider include:   (1) Consideration of the balance of custody exposure available after imposition of presentence custody credits;   (2) The defendant\u2019s present status on probation, mandatory supervision, postrelease community supervision, or parole;  (3) Specific factors related to the defendant that indicate a lack of need for treatment or supervision upon release from custody; and  (4) Whether the nature, seriousness, or circumstances of the case or the defendant\u2019s past performance on supervision substantially outweigh the benefits of supervision in promoting public safety and the defendant\u2019s successful reentry into the community upon release from custody.  (c) Criteria affecting conditions and length of mandatory supervision  In exercising discretion to select the appropriate period and conditions of mandatory supervision, factors the court may consider include:   (1) Availability of appropriate community corrections programs;  (2) Victim restitution, including any conditions or period of supervision necessary to promote the collection of any court-ordered restitution;  (3) Consideration of length and conditions of supervision to promote the successful reintegration of the defendant into the community upon release from custody;  (4) Public safety, including protection of any victims and witnesses;  (5) Past performance and present status on probation, mandatory supervision, postrelease community supervision, and parole;  (6) The balance of custody exposure after imposition of presentence custody credits;  (7) Consideration of the statutory accrual of post-sentence custody credits for mandatory supervision under section 1170(h)(5)(B) and sentences served in county jail under section 4019(a)(6);  72  (8) The defendant\u2019s specific needs and risk factors identified by a risk/needs assessment, if available; and  (9) The likely effect of extended imprisonment on the defendant and any dependents.   (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2018.)  (d) Statement of reasons for denial of mandatory supervision  Notwithstanding rule 4.412(a), when a court denies a period of mandatory supervision in the interests of justice, the court must state the reasons for the denial on the record.  Rule 4.415 amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted effective January 1, 2015; previously amended effective January 1, 2017.  Advisory Committee Comment  Penal Code section 1170.3 requires the Judicial Council to adopt rules of court that prescribe criteria for the consideration of the court at the time of sentencing regarding the court\u2019s decision to \u201c[d]eny a period of mandatory supervision in the interests of justice under paragraph (5) of subdivision (h) of Section 1170 or determine the appropriate period of and conditions of mandatory supervision.\u201d  Subdivision (a). Penal Code section 1170(h)(5)(A): \u201cUnless the court finds, in the interests of justice, that it is not appropriate in a particular case, the court, when imposing a sentence pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision, shall suspend execution of a concluding portion of the term for a period selected at the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d Under People v. Borynack  (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 958, review denied, courts may not impose mandatory supervision when the defendant is statutorily ineligible for a suspension of part of the sentence.  Subdivisions (b)(3), (b)(4), and (c)(3). The Legislature has declared that \u201c[s]trategies supporting reentering offenders through practices and programs, such as standardized risk and needs assessments, transitional community housing, treatment, medical and mental health services, and employment, have been demonstrated to significantly reduce recidivism among offenders in other states.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 17.7(a).) \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": "Subdivision (c)(7). Under Penal Code section 1170(h)(5)(B), defendants serving a period of mandatory supervision are entitled to day-for-day credits: \u201cDuring the period when the defendant is under such supervision, unless in actual custody related to the sentence imposed by the court, the defendant shall be entitled to only actual time credit against the term of imprisonment imposed by the court.\u201d In contrast, defendants serving terms of imprisonment in county jails under Penal Code section 1170(h) are entitled to conduct credits under Penal Code section 4019(a)(6).  Subdivision (c)(8). Standard 4.35 of the California Standards of Judicial Administration provides courts with additional guidance on using the results of a risk/needs assessment at sentencing.  73  Rule 4.420.  Selection of term of imprisonment  (a) When a judgment of imprisonment is imposed, or the execution of a judgment of imprisonment is ordered suspended, the sentencing judge must, in their sound discretion, order imposition of a sentence not to exceed the middle term, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b).  (Subd (a) amended effective March 14, 2022; previously amended effective July 28, 1977, January 1, 1991, January 1, 2007, and May 23, 2007.)  (b) The court may only choose an upper term when (1) there are circumstances in aggravation of the crime that justify the imposition of an upper term, and (2) the facts underlying those circumstances have been (i) stipulated to by the defendant, (ii) found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by a jury, or (iii) found true beyond a reasonable doubt by the judge in a court trial.  (Subd (b) adopted effective March 14, 2022.)  (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b), the court may consider the fact of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions based on a certified record of conviction without it having been stipulated to by the defendant or found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by a jury or the judge in a court trial. This exception does not apply to the use of the record of a prior conviction in selecting the upper term of an enhancement.   (Subd (c) adopted effective March 14, 2022.)   (d) In selecting between the middle and lower terms of imprisonment, the sentencing judge may consider circumstances in aggravation or mitigation, and any other factor reasonably related to the sentencing decision. The court may consider factors in aggravation and mitigation, whether or not the factors have been stipulated to by the defendant or found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by a jury or the judge in a court trial. The relevant circumstances may be obtained from the case record, the probation officer\u2019s report, other reports and statements properly received, statements in aggravation or mitigation, and any evidence introduced at the sentencing hearing.

(e) Notwithstanding section 1170(b)(1), and unless the court finds that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances such that imposition of the lower term would be contrary to the interests of justice, the court must order  74 imposition of the lower term if any of the following was a contributing factor in the commission of the offense:   (1) The defendant has experienced psychological, physical, or childhood trauma, including, but not limited to, abuse, neglect, exploitation, or sexual violence;  (2) The defendant is a youth, or was a youth as defined under section 1016.7(b) at the time of the commission of the offense; or  (3) Prior to the instant offense, or at the time of the commission of the offense, the defendant is or was a victim of intimate partner violence or human trafficking.   (Subd (e) adopted effective March 14, 2022.)   (f) Paragraph (e) does not preclude the court from imposing the lower term even if there is no evidence of the circumstances listed in paragraph (e).  (Subd (f) adopted effective March 14, 2022.)  (g) To comply with section 1170(b)(5), a fact charged and found as an enhancement may be used as a reason for imposing a particular term only if the court has discretion to strike the punishment for the enhancement and does so. The use of a fact of an enhancement to impose the upper term of imprisonment is an adequate reason for striking the additional term of imprisonment, regardless of the effect on the total term.

Advisory Committee Comment  It is not clear whether the reasons stated by the judge for selecting a particular term qualify as \u201cfacts\u201d for the purposes of the rule prohibition on dual use of facts. Until the issue is clarified, judges should avoid the use of reasons that may constitute an impermissible dual use of facts. For example, the court is not permitted to use a reason to impose a greater term if that reason also is either (1) the same as an enhancement that will be imposed, or (2) an element of the crime. The court should not use the same reason to impose a consecutive sentence as to impose an upper term of imprisonment. ( People v. Avalos  (1984) 37 Cal.3d 216, 233.) It is not improper to use the same reason to deny probation and to impose the upper term. ( People v. Bowen (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 102, 106.)  The rule makes it clear that a fact charged and found as an enhancement may, in the alternative, be used as a factor in aggravation.  People v. Riolo  (1983) 33 Cal.3d 223, 227 (and note 5 on 227) held that section 1170.1(a) does not require the judgment to state the base term (upper, middle, or lower) and enhancements, computed independently, on counts that are subject to automatic reduction under the one-third formula of section 1170.1(a).  Even when sentencing is under section 1170.1, however, it is essential to determine the base term and specific enhancements for each count independently, in order to know which is the principal term count. The principal term count must be determined before any calculation is made using the one-third formula for subordinate terms.  In addition, the base term (upper, middle, or lower) for each count must be determined to arrive at an informed decision whether to make terms consecutive or concurrent; and the base term for each count must be stated in the judgment when sentences are concurrent or are fully consecutive (i.e., not subject to the one-third rule of section 1170.1(a)).  Case law suggests that in determining the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d the court should consider the constitutional rights of the defendant and the interests of society represented by the people; the defendant\u2019s background and prospects, including the presence or absence of a record; the nature and circumstances of the crime and the defendant\u2019s level of involvement; the factors in aggravation and mitigation including the specific factors in mitigation of Penal Code section 1170(b)(6); and the factors that would motivate a \u201creasonable judge\u201d in the exercise of their discretion. The court should not consider whether the defendant has simply pled guilty, factors related to controlling the court\u2019s calendar, or antipathy toward the statutory scheme. (See People v. Romero  (1996) 13 Cal.4th 947; People v. Dent  (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1726; People v. Kessel (1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 322; People v. Orin  (1975) 13 Cal.3d 937.)  Rule 4.421.  Circumstances in aggravation  Circumstances in aggravation include factors relating to the crime and factors relating to the defendant.  76  (a) Factors relating to the crime  Factors relating to the crime, whether or not charged or chargeable as enhancements include that:  (1) The crime involved great violence, great bodily harm, threat of great bodily harm, or other acts disclosing a high degree of cruelty, viciousness, or callousness;  (2) The defendant was armed with or used a weapon at the time of the commission of the crime;  (3) The victim was particularly vulnerable;  (4) The defendant induced others to participate in the commission of the crime or occupied a position of leadership or dominance of other participants in its commission;  (5) The defendant induced a minor to commit or assist in the commission of the crime;  (6) The defendant threatened witnesses, unlawfully prevented or dissuaded witnesses from testifying, suborned perjury, or in any other way illegally interfered with the judicial process;  (7) The defendant was convicted of other crimes for which consecutive sentences could have been imposed but for which concurrent sentences are being imposed;  (8) The manner in which the crime was carried out indicates planning, sophistication, or professionalism;  (9) The crime involved an attempted or actual taking or damage of great monetary value;  (10) The crime involved a large quantity of contraband; and  (11) The defendant took advantage of a position of trust or confidence to commit the offense.  (12) The crime constitutes a hate crime under section 422.55 and:  (A) No hate crime enhancements under section 422.75 are imposed; and  (B) The crime is not subject to sentencing under section 1170.8.   77  (Subd (a) amended effective May 23, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 1991, and January 1, 2007.)  (b) Factors relating to the defendant  Factors relating to the defendant include that:  (1) The defendant has engaged in violent conduct that indicates a serious danger to society;  (2) The defendant\u2019s prior convictions as an adult or sustained petitions in juvenile delinquency proceedings are numerous or of increasing seriousness;  (3) The defendant has served a prior term in prison or county jail under section 1170(h);  (4) The defendant was on probation, mandatory supervision, postrelease community supervision, or parole when the crime was committed; and  (5) The defendant\u2019s prior performance on probation, mandatory supervision, postrelease community supervision, or parole was unsatisfactory.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2017; previously amended effective January 1, 1991, January 1, 2007, and May 23, 2007.)

{"prompt": "reasonably relate to the defendant or the circumstances under which the crime was committed.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted effective January 1, 1991; previously amended effective January 1, 2007, and May 23, 2007.)

Advisory Committee Comment  Courts may not impose a sentence greater than the middle term except when aggravating factors justifying the imposition of the upper term have been stipulated to by the defendant or found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by the jury or the judge in a court trial. These requirements do not apply to consideration of aggravating factors for the lower or middle term. If the court finds that any of the factors listed in section 1170(b)(6)(A\u2013C) were a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the court must impose the lower term (see rule 4.420(e)) unless the court finds that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors to such a degree that  78 imposing the lower term would be contrary to the interests of justice. In this instance, since the court is not addressing the imposition of the upper term, the court may consider factors in aggravation that have not been stipulated to by the defendant or found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by the jury or the judge in a court trial.  In determining whether to impose the upper term for a criminal offense, the court may consider as an aggravating factor that a defendant has suffered one or more prior convictions, based on a certified record of conviction. This exception may not be used to select the upper term of an enhancement.   This rule does not deal with the dual use of the facts; the statutory prohibition against dual use is included, in part, in the comment to rule 4.420.  Refusal to consider the personal characteristics of the defendant in imposing sentence may raise serious constitutional questions. The California Supreme Court has held that sentencing decisions must take into account \u201cthe nature of the offense and/or the offender, with particular regard to the degree of danger both present to society.\u201d (In re Rodriguez (1975) 14 Cal.3d 639, 654, quoting In  re Lynch (1972) 8 Cal.3d 410, 425.) In  Rodriguez the court released petitioner from further incarceration because \u201cit appears that neither the circumstances of his offense nor his personal characteristics establish a danger to society sufficient to justify such a prolonged period of imprisonment.\u201d ( Id. at p. 655, fn. omitted, italics added.) \u201cFor the determination of sentences, justice generally requires . . . that there be taken into account the circumstances of the offense together with the character and propensities of the offender.\u201d ( Pennsylvania ex rel. Sullivan v. Ashe (1937) 302 U.S. 51, 55, quoted with approval in Gregg v. Georgia (1976) 428 U.S. 153, 189.)  Other statutory factors in aggravation are listed, for example, in sections 422.76, 1170.7, 1170.71, 1170.8, and 1170.85, and may be considered to impose the upper term if stipulated to by the defendant or found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by a jury or the judge in a court trial.  Rule 4.423.  Circumstances in mitigation  Circumstances in mitigation include factors relating to the crime and factors relating to the defendant.  (a) Factors relating to the crime  Factors relating to the crime include that:  (1) The defendant was a passive participant or played a minor role in the crime;  (2) The victim was an initiator of, willing participant in, or aggressor or provoker of the incident;  (3) The crime was committed because of an unusual circumstance, such as great provocation, that is unlikely to recur;  (4) The defendant participated in the crime under circumstances of coercion or duress, or the criminal conduct was partially excusable for some other reason not amounting to a defense;  79  (5) The defendant, with no apparent predisposition to do so, was induced by others to participate in the crime;  (6) The defendant exercised caution to avoid harm to persons or damage to property, or the amounts of money or property taken were deliberately small, or no harm was done or threatened against the victim;  (7) The defendant believed that he or she had a claim or right to the property taken, or for other reasons mistakenly believed that the conduct was legal;  (8) The defendant was motivated by a desire to provide necessities for his or her family or self; and  (9) The defendant suffered from repeated or continuous physical, sexual, or psychological abuse inflicted by the victim of the crime, and the victim of the crime, who inflicted the abuse, was the defendant\u2019s spouse, intimate cohabitant, or parent of the defendant\u2019s child; and the abuse does not amount to a defense.  (10) If a firearm was used in the commission of the offense, it was unloaded or inoperable.   (Subd (a) amended effective March 14, 2022; previously amended effective January 1, 1991, July 1, 1993, January 1, 2007, and May 23, 2007.)  (b) Factors relating to the defendant  Factors relating to the defendant include that:  (1) The defendant has no prior record, or has an insignificant record of criminal conduct, considering the recency and frequency of prior crimes;  (2) The defendant was suffering from a mental or physical condition that significantly reduced culpability for the crime;  (3) The defendant experienced psychological, physical, or childhood trauma, including, but not limited to, abuse, neglect, exploitation, or sexual violence and it was a factor in the commission of the crime;  (4) The commission of the current offense is connected to the defendant\u2019s prior victimization or childhood trauma, or mental illness as defined by section 1385(c);   80 (5) The defendant is or was a victim of intimate partner violence or human trafficking at the time of the commission of the offense, and it was a factor in the commission of the offense;  (6) The defendant is under 26 years of age, or was under 26 years of age at the time of the commission of the offense;  (7) The defendant was a juvenile when they committed the current offense;  (8) The defendant voluntarily acknowledged wrongdoing before arrest or at an early stage of the criminal process;  (9) The defendant is ineligible for probation and but for that ineligibility would have been granted probation;  (10) Application of an enhancement could result in a sentence over 20 years;  (11) Multiple enhancements are alleged in a single case;  (12) Application of an enhancement could result in a discriminatory racial impact;  (13) An enhancement is based on a prior conviction that is over five years old;  (14) The defendant made restitution to the victim; and  (15) The defendant\u2019s prior performance on probation, mandatory supervision, postrelease community supervision, or parole was satisfactory.  (Subd (b) renumbered and amended effective March 14, 2022; previously amended effective January 1, 1991, January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, and January 1, 2017.)

Advisory Committee Comment   See comment to rule 4.421.   81 This rule applies both to mitigation for purposes of section 1170(b) and to circumstances in mitigation justifying the court in striking the additional punishment provided for an enhancement.  Some listed circumstances can never apply to certain enhancements; for example, \u201cthe amounts taken were deliberately small\u201d can never apply to an excessive taking under section 12022.6, and \u201cno harm was done\u201d can never apply to infliction of great bodily injury under section 12022.7. In any case, only the facts present may be considered for their possible effect in mitigation.  See also rule 4.409; only relevant criteria need be considered.  Since only the fact of restitution is considered relevant to mitigation, no reference to the defendant\u2019s financial ability is needed. The omission of a comparable factor from rule 4.421 as a circumstance in aggravation is deliberate.  Rule 4.424.  Consideration of applicability of section 654  Before determining whether to impose either concurrent or consecutive sentences on all counts on which the defendant was convicted, the court must determine whether the proscription in section 654 against multiple punishments for the same act or omission requires a stay of execution of the sentence imposed on some of the counts. If a stay of execution is required due to the prohibition against multiple punishments for the same act, the court has discretion to choose which act or omission will be punished and which will be stayed.   Rule 4.424 amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted as rule 424 effective January 1, 1991; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2011.  Rule 4.425. Factors affecting concurrent or consecutive sentences  Factors affecting the decision to impose consecutive rather than concurrent sentences include:  (a) Facts relating to crimes  Facts relating to the crimes, including whether or not:  (1) The crimes and their objectives were predominantly independent of each other;  (2) The crimes involved separate acts of violence or threats of violence; or  (3) The crimes were committed at different times or separate places, rather than being committed so closely in time and place as to indicate a single period of aberrant behavior.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective January 1, 1991, and January 1, 2007.)  82  (b) Other facts and limitations  Any circumstances in aggravation or mitigation, whether or not the factors have been stipulated to by the defendant or found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by a jury or the judge in a court trial, may be considered in deciding whether to impose consecutive rather than concurrent sentences, except:  (1) A fact used to impose the upper term;  (2) A fact used to otherwise enhance the defendant\u2019s sentence in prison or county jail under section 1170(h); and  (3) A fact that is an element of the crime.

{"prompt": "(a) Multiple violent sex crimes   When a defendant has been convicted of multiple violent sex offenses as defined in section 667.6, the sentencing judge must determine whether the crimes involved separate victims or the same victim on separate occasions.  (1) Different victims    If the crimes were committed against different victims, a full, separate, and consecutive term must be imposed for a violent sex crime as to each victim, under section 667.6(d).  (2) Same victim, separate occasions   If the crimes were committed against a single victim, the sentencing judge must determine whether the crimes were committed on separate occasions. In determining whether there were separate occasions, the sentencing judge must consider whether, between the commission of one sex crime and  83 another, the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to reflect on his or her actions and nevertheless resumed sexually assaultive behavior. A full, separate, and consecutive term must be imposed for each violent sex offense committed on a separate occasion under section 667.6(d).  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Same victim, same occasion; other crimes   If the defendant has been convicted of multiple crimes, including at least one violent sex crime, as defined in section 667.6, or if there have been multiple violent sex crimes against a single victim on the same occasion and the sentencing court has decided to impose consecutive sentences, the sentencing judge must then determine whether to impose a full, separate, and consecutive sentence under section 667.6(c) for the violent sex crime or crimes instead of including the violent sex crimes in the computation of the principal and subordinate terms under section 1170.1(a). A decision to impose a fully consecutive sentence under section 667.6(c) is an additional sentence choice that requires a statement of reasons separate from those given for consecutive sentences, but which may repeat the same reasons. The sentencing judge is to be guided by the criteria listed in rule 4.425, which incorporates rules 4.421 and 4.423, as well as any other reasonably related criteria as provided in rule 4.408.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective July 1, 2003.)  Rule 4.426 amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as rule 426 effective January 1, 1991; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective July 1, 2003.  Advisory Committee Comment  Section 667.6(d) requires a full, separate, and consecutive term for each of the enumerated violent sex crimes that involve separate victims, or the same victim on separate occasions. Therefore, if there were separate victims or the court found that there were separate occasions, no other reasons are required.  If there have been multiple convictions involving at least one of the enumerated violent sex crimes, the court may impose a full, separate, and consecutive term for each violent sex crime under section 667.6(c). (See People v. Coleman  (1989) 48 Cal.3d 112, 161.) A fully consecutive sentence under section 667.6(c) is a sentence choice, which requires a statement of reasons. The court may not use the same fact to impose a sentence under section 667.6(c) that was used to impose an upper term. (See rule 4.425(b).) If the court selects the upper term, imposes consecutive sentences, and uses section 667.6(c), the record must reflect three sentencing choices with three separate statements of reasons, but the same reason may be used for sentencing under section 667.6(c) and to impose consecutive sentences. (See People v. Belmontes  (1983) 34 Cal.3d 335, 347\u2013349.)   84 Rule 4.427.  Hate crimes  (a) Application  This rule is intended to assist judges in sentencing in felony hate crime cases.  It applies to:  (1) Felony sentencing under section 422.7;  (2) Convictions of felonies with a hate crime enhancement under section 422.75; and   (3) Convictions of felonies that qualify as hate crimes under section 422.55.  (b) Felony sentencing under section 422.7  If one of the three factors listed in section 422.7 is pled and proved, a misdemeanor conviction that constitutes a hate crime under section 422.55 may be sentenced as a felony. The punishment is imprisonment in state prison or county jail under section 1170(h) as provided by section 422.7.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2017.)  (c) Hate crime enhancement    If a hate crime enhancement is pled and proved, the punishment for a felony conviction must be enhanced under section 422.75 unless the conviction is sentenced as a felony under section 422.7.    (1) The following enhancements apply:  (A) An enhancement of a term in state prison as provided in section 422.75(a).  Personal use of a firearm in the commission of the offense is an aggravating factor that must be considered in determining the enhancement term.  (B) An additional enhancement of one year in state prison for each prior felony conviction that constitutes a hate crime as defined in section 422.55.    (2) The court may strike enhancements under (c) if it finds mitigating circumstances under rule 4.423, or pursuant to section 1385(c) and states those mitigating circumstances on the record.  (3) The punishment for any enhancement under (c) is in addition to any other punishment provided by law.   85 (Subd (c) amended effective March 14, 2022.  (d) Hate crime as aggravating factor    If the defendant is convicted of a felony, and the facts of the crime constitute a hate crime under section 422.55, that fact must be considered a circumstance in aggravation in determining the appropriate punishment under rule 4.421 unless:  (1) The court imposed a hate crime enhancement under section 422.75; or  (2) The defendant has been convicted of an offense subject to sentencing under section 1170.8.  (e) Hate crime sentencing goals   When sentencing a defendant under this rule, the judge must consider the principal goals for hate crime sentencing.    (1) The principal goals for hate crime sentencing, as stated in section 422.86, are:  (A) Punishment for the hate crime committed;  (B) Crime and violence prevention, including prevention of recidivism and prevention of crimes and violence in prisons and jails; and   (C) Restorative justice for the immediate victims of the hate crimes and for the classes of persons terrorized by the hate crimes.   (2) Crime and violence prevention considerations should include educational or other appropriate programs available in the community, jail, prison, and juvenile detention facilities.  The programs should address sensitivity or similar training or counseling intended to reduce violent and antisocial behavior based on one or more of the following actual or perceived characteristics of the victim:  (A) Disability;  (B) Gender;   (C) Nationality;  (D) Race or ethnicity;  (E) Religion;  (F) Sexual orientation; or   86 (G) Association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics.   (3) Restorative justice considerations should include community service and other programs focused on hate crime prevention or diversity sensitivity.  Additionally, the court should consider ordering payment or other compensation to programs that provide services to violent crime victims and reimbursement to the victim for reasonable costs of counseling and other reasonable expenses that the court finds are a direct result of the defendant\u2019s actions.  Rule 4.427 amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted effective January 1, 2007: previously amended effective January 1, 2017.  Advisory Committee Comment  Multiple enhancements for prior convictions under subdivision (c)(1)(B) may be imposed if the prior convictions have been brought and tried separately.  (Pen. Code, \u00a7 422.75(d).  In order to impose the upper term based on section 422.75, the fact of the enhancement pursuant to sections 422.55 or 422.6 must be stipulated to by the defendant or found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by the jury or the judge in a court trial.  Any enhancement alleged pursuant to this section may be dismissed pursuant to section 1385(c).   Rule 4.428. Factors affecting imposition of enhancements  (a) Enhancements punishable by one of three terms  If an enhancement is punishable by one of three terms, the court must, in its sound discretion, order imposition of a sentence not to exceed the middle term, unless there are circumstances in aggravation that justify the imposition of a term of imprisonment exceeding the middle term, and the facts underlying those circumstances have been stipulated to by the defendant, or have been found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by the jury or by the judge in a court trial.   (Subd (a) amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted effective January 1, 2018.)  (b) Striking or dismissing enhancements under section 1385  If the court has discretion under section 1385(a) to strike an enhancement in the interests of justice, the court also has the authority to strike the punishment for the enhancement under section 1385(b). In determining whether to strike the entire enhancement or only the punishment for the enhancement, the court may consider the effect that striking the enhancement would have on the status of the crime as a strike, the accurate reflection of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct on his or her  87 record, the effect it may have on the award of custody credits, and any other relevant consideration.  (Subd (b) amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted effective January 1, 2018.)  (c) Dismissing enhancements under section 1385(c)    (1) The court shall exercise the discretion to dismiss an enhancement if it is in the furtherance of justice to do so, unless the dismissal is prohibited by initiative statute.  (2) In exercising its discretion under section 1385(c), the court must consider and afford great weight to evidence offered by the defendant to prove that any of the mitigating circumstances in section 1385(c) are present.   (A)  Proof of the presence of one or more of these circumstances weighs greatly in favor of dismissing the enhancement, unless the court finds that dismissal of the enhancement would endanger public safety.   (B) The circumstances listed in 1385(c) are not exclusive.  (C) \u201cEndanger public safety\u201d means there is a likelihood that the dismissal of the enhancement would result in physical injury or other serious danger to others.  (3) If the court dismisses the enhancement pursuant to 1385(c), then both the enhancement and its punishment must be dismissed.  (Subd (c) adopted effective March 14, 2022.) Rule 4.428 amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted as rule 428 effective January 1, 1991; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 1998, July 1, 2003, January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, January 1, 2008, January 1, 2011, and January 18, 2022.  Advisory Committee Comment  Case law suggests that in determining the \u201cfurtherance of justice\u201d the court should consider the constitutional rights of the defendant and the interests of society represented by the people; the defendant\u2019s background and prospects, including the presence or absence of a record; the nature and circumstances of the crime and the defendant\u2019s level of involvement; the factors in aggravation and mitigation including the specific factors in mitigation of section 1385(c); and the \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": "should not consider whether the defendant has simply pled guilty, factors related to controlling the court\u2019s calendar, or antipathy toward the statutory scheme. (See People v. Romero  (1996) 13 Cal.4th 947; People v. Dent  (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1726; People v. Kessel  (1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 322; People v. Orin  (1975) 13 Cal.3d 937.)   88 How to afford great weight to a mitigating circumstance is not further explained in section 1385. The court is not directed to give conclusive weight to the mitigating factors, and must still engage in a weighing of both mitigating and aggravating factors. A review of case law suggests that the court can find great weight when there is an absence of \u201csubstantial evidence of countervailing considerations of sufficient weight to overcome\u201d the presumption of dismissal when the mitigating factors are present. ( People v. Martin  (1996) 42 Cal.3d 437.) In exercising this discretion, the court may rely on aggravating factors that have not been stipulated to by the defendant or proven beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by a jury or a judge in a court trial. (People v. Black  (2007) 41 Cal.4th 799.)   Rule 4.431.  Proceedings at sentencing to be reported  All proceedings at the time of sentencing must be reported.  Rule 4.431 amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as rule 431 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001.  Advisory Committee Comment  Reporters\u2019 transcripts of the sentencing proceedings are required on appeal (rule 8.320, except in certain cases under subdivision (d) of that rule), and when the defendant is sentenced to prison (section 1203.01).  Rule 4.433.  Matters to be considered at time set for sentencing  (a) In every case, at the time set for sentencing under section 1191, the sentencing judge must hold a hearing at which the judge must:  (1) Hear and determine any matters raised by the defendant under section 1201;  (2) Determine whether a defendant who is eligible for probation should be granted or denied probation, unless consideration of probation is expressly waived by the defendant personally and by counsel; and  (3) Determine whether to deny a period of mandatory supervision in the interests of justice under section 1170(h)(5)(A).  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2017; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) If the imposition of a sentence is to be suspended during a period of probation after a conviction by trial, the trial judge must identify and state circumstances that would justify imposition of one of the three authorized terms of imprisonment referred to in section 1170(b), or any enhancement, if probation is later revoked. The circumstances identified and stated by the judge must be based on evidence admitted at the trial or other circumstances properly considered under rule 4.420(b).   89 (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective July 28, 1977, January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, January 1, 2008, and January 1, 2017.)  (c) If a sentence of imprisonment is to be imposed, or if the execution of a sentence of imprisonment is to be suspended during a period of probation, the sentencing judge must:  (1) Determine, under section 1170(b), whether to impose one of the three authorized terms of imprisonment referred to in section 1170(b), or any enhancement, and state on the record the reasons for imposing that term;  (2) Determine whether any additional term of imprisonment provided for an enhancement charged and found will be stricken;  (3) Determine whether the sentences will be consecutive or concurrent if the defendant has been convicted of multiple crimes;  (4) Determine any issues raised by statutory prohibitions on the dual use of facts and statutory limitations on enhancements, as required in rules 4.420(c) and 4.447; and  (5) Pronounce the court\u2019s judgment and sentence, stating the terms thereof and giving reasons for those matters for which reasons are required by law.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective July 28, 1977, July 1, 2003, January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, and January 1, 2017.)  (d) All these matters must be heard and determined at a single hearing unless the sentencing judge otherwise orders in the interests of justice.   (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (e) When a sentence of imprisonment is imposed under (c) or under rule 4.435, the sentencing judge must inform the defendant:  (1) Under section 1170(c) of the parole period provided by section 3000 to be served after expiration of the sentence, in addition to any period of incarceration for parole violation;  (2) Of the period of postrelease community supervision provided by section 3456 to be served after expiration of the sentence, in addition to any period of incarceration for a violation of postrelease community supervision; or   (3) Of any period of mandatory supervision imposed under section 1170(h)(5)(A) and (B), in addition to any period of imprisonment for a violation of mandatory supervision.   90 (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective July 28, 1977, January 1, 1979, July 1, 2003, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2017.)  Rule 4.433 amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted as rule 433 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective July 28, 1977, January 1, 1979, July 1, 2003, January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, January 1, 2008, and January 1, 2017.  Advisory Committee Comment  This rule summarizes the questions that the court is required to consider at the time of sentencing, in their logical order.  Subdivision (a)(2) makes it clear that probation should be considered in every case, without the necessity of any application, unless the defendant is statutorily ineligible for probation.  Under subdivision (b), when imposition of sentence is to be suspended, the sentencing judge is not to make any determinations as to possible length of a term of imprisonment on violation of probation (section 1170(b)). If there was a trial, however, the judge must state on the record the circumstances that would justify imposition of one of the three authorized terms of imprisonment based on the trial evidence.  Subdivision (d) makes it clear that all sentencing matters should be disposed of at a single hearing unless strong reasons exist for a continuance.  Rule 4.435. Sentencing on revocation of probation, mandatory supervision, and postrelease community supervision  (a) When the defendant violates the terms of probation, mandatory supervision, or postrelease community supervision or is otherwise subject to revocation of supervision, the sentencing judge may make any disposition of the case authorized by statute. In deciding whether to permanently revoke supervision, the judge may consider the nature of the violation and the defendant\u2019s past performance on supervision.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective January 1, 1991.)  (b) On revocation and termination of supervision under section 1203.2, when the sentencing judge determines that the defendant will be committed to prison or county jail under section 1170(h):  (1) If the imposition of sentence was previously suspended, the judge must impose judgment and sentence after considering any findings previously made and hearing and determining the matters enumerated in rule 4.433(c). The length of the sentence must be based on circumstances existing at the time supervision was granted, and subsequent events may not be considered  91 in selecting the base term or in deciding whether to strike the additional punishment for enhancements charged and found.  (2) If the execution of sentence was previously suspended, the judge must order that the judgment previously pronounced be in full force and effect and that the defendant be committed to the custody of the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or local county correctional administrator or sheriff for the term prescribed in that judgment.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective July 1, 2003, January 1, 2006, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2017.)  Rule 4.435 amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted as rule 435 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 1991, July 1, 2003, January 1, 2006, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2017.  Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivision (a) makes it clear that there is no change in the court\u2019s power, on finding cause to revoke and terminate supervision under section 1203.2(a), to continue the defendant on supervision.  The restriction of subdivision (b)(1) is based on In re Rodriguez (1975) 14 Cal.3d 639, 652: \u201c[T]he primary term must reflect the circumstances existing at the time of the offense.\u201d  A judge imposing imprisonment on revocation of probation will have the power granted by section 1170(d) to recall the commitment on his or her own motion within 120 days after the date of commitment, and the power under section 1203.2(e) to set aside the revocation of probation, for good cause, within 30 days after the court has notice that execution of the sentence has commenced.  Consideration of conduct occurring after the granting of probation should be distinguished from consideration of preprobation conduct that is discovered after the granting of an order of probation and before sentencing following a revocation and termination of probation. If the preprobation conduct affects or nullifies a determination made at the time probation was granted, the preprobation conduct may properly be considered at sentencing following revocation and termination of probation. (See People v. Griffith (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 796, 801.) While People v. Griffith  refers only to probation, this rule likely will apply to any form of supervision.   Rule 4.437.  Statements in aggravation and mitigation  (a) Time for filing and service  Statements in aggravation and mitigation referred to in section 1170(b) must be filed and served at least four days before the time set for sentencing under section 1191 or the time set for pronouncing judgment on revocation of probation under section 1203.2(c) if imposition of sentence was previously suspended.   92 (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Combined statement  A party seeking consideration of circumstances in aggravation or mitigation may file and serve a statement under section 1170(b) and this rule.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (c) Contents of statement  A statement in aggravation or mitigation must include:  (1) A summary of evidence that the party relies on as circumstances justifying the imposition of a particular term; and  (2) Notice of intention to dispute facts or offer evidence in aggravation or mitigation at the sentencing hearing. The statement must generally describe the evidence to be offered, including a description of any documents and the names and expected substance of the testimony of any witnesses. No evidence in aggravation or mitigation may be introduced at the sentencing hearing unless it was described in the statement, or unless its admission is permitted by the sentencing judge in the interests of justice.  (Subd (c) amended effective May 23, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (d) Support required for assertions of fact  Assertions of fact in a statement in aggravation or mitigation must be disregarded unless they are supported by the record in the case, the probation officer\u2019s report or \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": " (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (e) Disputed facts  In the event the parties dispute the facts on which the conviction rested, the court must conduct a presentence hearing and make appropriate corrections, additions, or deletions in the presentence probation report or order a revised report.  (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted effective January 1, 1991.)  Rule 4.437 amended effective May 23, 2007; adopted as rule 437 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective July 28, 1977, January 1, 1991, and January 1, 2007.   93 Advisory Committee Comment  Section 1170(b)(4) states in part:  \u201cAt least four days prior to the time set for imposition of judgment, either party or the victim, or the family of the victim if the victim is deceased, may submit a statement in aggravation or mitigation to dispute facts in the record or the probation officer\u2019s report, or to present additional facts.\u201d  This provision means that the statement is a document giving notice of intention to dispute evidence in the record or the probation officer\u2019s report, or to present additional facts.  The statement itself cannot be the medium for presenting new evidence, or for rebutting competent evidence already presented, because the statement is a unilateral presentation by one party or counsel that will not necessarily have any indicia of reliability. To allow its factual assertions to be considered in the absence of corroborating evidence would, therefore, constitute a denial of due process of law in violation of the United States (14th Amend.) and California (art. I, \u00a7 7) Constitutions.  The requirement that the statement include notice of intention to rely on new evidence will enhance fairness to both sides by avoiding surprise and helping to ensure that the time limit on pronouncing sentence is met. This notice may include either party\u2019s intention to provide evidence to prove or contest the existence of a factor in mitigation that would require imposition of the low term for the underlying offense or dismissal of an enhancement.   Rule 4.447. Sentencing of enhancements  (a) Enhancements resulting in unlawful sentences  Except pursuant to section 1385(c), a court may not strike or dismiss an enhancement solely because imposition of the term is prohibited by law or exceeds limitations on the imposition of multiple enhancements. Instead, the court must:  (1) Impose a sentence for the aggregate term of imprisonment computed without reference to those prohibitions or limitations; and  (2) Stay execution of the part of the term that is prohibited or exceeds the applicable limitation. The stay will become permanent once the defendant finishes serving the part of the sentence that has not been stayed.  (Subd (a) amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted effective January 1, 2018.)  (b) Multiple enhancements  Notwithstanding section 1385(c), if a defendant is convicted of multiple enhancements of the same type, the court must either sentence each enhancement or, if authorized, strike the enhancement or its punishment. While the court may  94 strike an enhancement, the court may not stay an enhancement except as provided in (a) or as authorized by section 654.  (Subd (b) amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted effective January 1, 2018.)  Rule 4.447 amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted as rule 447 effective July 1, 1977; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective July 28, 1977, January 1, 1991, July 1, 2003, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2018.   Advisory Committee Comment   Subdivision (a). Statutory restrictions may prohibit or limit the imposition of an enhancement in certain situations. (See, for example, sections 186.22(b)(1), 667(a)(2), 667.61(f), 1170.1(f) and (g), 12022.53(e)(2) and (f), and Vehicle Code section 23558.)  Section 1385(c) requires that in the furtherance of justice certain enhancements be dismissed unless dismissal is prohibited by any initiative statute.    Present practice of staying execution is followed to avoid violating a statutory prohibition or exceeding a statutory limitation, while preserving the possibility of imposition of the stayed portion should a reversal on appeal reduce the unstayed portion of the sentence. (See People v. Gonzalez (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1118, 1129\u20131130; People v. Niles (1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 749, 756.)  Only the portion of a sentence or component thereof that exceeds a limitation is prohibited, and this rule provides a procedure for that situation. This rule applies to both determinate and indeterminate terms.  Subdivision (b). A court may stay an enhancement if section 654 applies. (See People v. Bradley (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 386; People v. Haykel (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 146, 152.)  Rule 4.451. Sentence consecutive to or concurrent with indeterminate term or term in other jurisdiction  (a) When a defendant is sentenced under section 1170 and the sentence is to run consecutively to or concurrently with a sentence imposed under section 1168(b) in the same or another proceeding, the judgment must specify the determinate term imposed under section 1170 computed without reference to the indeterminate sentence, must order that the determinate term be served consecutively to or concurrently with the sentence under section 1168(b), and must identify the proceedings in which the indeterminate sentence was imposed. The term under section 1168(b), and the date of its completion or date of parole or postrelease community supervision, and the sequence in which the sentences are deemed or served, will be determined by correctional authorities as provided by law.   Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective January 1, 1979, July 1, 2003, and January 1. 2007.)   95 (b) When a defendant is sentenced under sections 1168 or 1170 and the sentence is to run consecutively to or concurrently with a sentence imposed by a court of the United States or of another state or territory, the judgment must specify the term imposed under sections 1168(b) or 1170 computed without reference to the sentence imposed by the other jurisdiction, must identify the other jurisdiction and the proceedings in which the other sentence was imposed, and must indicate whether the sentences are imposed concurrently or consecutively. If the term imposed is to be served consecutively to the term imposed by the other jurisdiction, the court must order that the California term be served commencing on the completion of the sentence imposed by the other jurisdiction.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended January 1, 2007.)  Rule 4.451 amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted as rule 451 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 1979, July 1, 2003, and January 1, 2007.  Advisory Committee Comment   Subdivision (a).  The provisions of section 1170.1(a), which use a one-third formula to calculate subordinate consecutive terms, can logically be applied only when all the sentences are imposed under section 1170. Indeterminate sentences are imposed under section 1168(b). Since the duration of the indeterminate term cannot be known to the court, subdivision (a) states the only feasible mode of sentencing. (See People v. Felix (2000) 22 Cal.4th 651, 654\u2013657; People v. McGahuey  (1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 524, 530\u2013532.)  Subdivision (b).  On the authority to sentence consecutively to the sentence of another jurisdiction and the effect of such a sentence, see In re Helpman (1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 307 and cases cited at page 310, footnote 3. The mode of sentencing required by subdivision (b) is necessary to avoid the illogical conclusion that the total of the consecutive sentences will depend on whether the other jurisdiction or California is the first to pronounce judgment.   Rule 4.452.  Determinate sentence consecutive to prior determinate sentence  (a) If a determinate sentence is imposed under section 1170.1(a) consecutive to one or more determinate sentences imposed previously in the same court or in other courts, the court in the current case must pronounce a single aggregate term, as defined in section 1170.1(a), stating the result of combining the previous and current sentences. In those situations:   (1) The sentences on all determinately sentenced counts in all the cases on which a sentence was or is being imposed must be combined as though they were all counts in the current case.  (2) The court in the current case must make a new determination of which count, in the combined cases, represents the principal term, as defined in section 1170.1(a). The principal term is the term with the greatest punishment  96 imposed including conduct enhancements. If two terms of imprisonment have the same punishment, either term may be selected as the principal term.  (3) Discretionary decisions of courts in previous cases may not be changed by the court in the current case. Such decisions include the decision to impose one of the three authorized terms of imprisonment referred to in section 1170(b), making counts in prior cases concurrent with or consecutive to each other, or the decision that circumstances in mitigation or in the furtherance of justice justified striking the punishment for an enhancement. However, if a previously designated principal term becomes a subordinate term after the resentencing, the subordinate term will be limited to one-third the middle base term as provided in section 1170.1(a).  (4) If all previously imposed sentences and the current sentence being imposed by the second or subsequent court are under section 1170(h), the second or subsequent court has the discretion to specify whether a previous sentence is to be served in custody or on mandatory supervision and the terms of such supervision, but may not, without express consent of the defendant, modify the sentence on the earlier sentenced charges in any manner that will (i) increase the total length of the sentence imposed by the previous court; (ii) increase the total length of the custody portion of the sentence imposed by the previous court; (iii) increase the total length of the mandatory supervision portion of the sentence imposed by the previous court; or (iv) impose additional, more onerous, or more restrictive conditions of release for any previously imposed period of mandatory supervision.  (5) If the second or subsequent court imposes a sentence to state prison because the defendant is ineligible for sentencing under section 1170(h), the jurisdiction of the second or subsequent court to impose a prison sentence applies solely to the current case. The defendant must be returned to the original sentencing court for potential resentencing on any previous case or cases sentenced under section 1170(h). The original sentencing court must convert all remaining custody and mandatory supervision time imposed in the previous case to state prison custody time and must determine whether its sentence is concurrent with or consecutive to the state prison term imposed by the second or subsequent court and incorporate that sentence into a single aggregate term as required by this rule. (A)(4) does not apply\u2014and the consent of the defendant is not required\u2014for this conversion and resentencing.  (6) In cases in which a sentence is imposed under the provisions of section 1170(h) and the sentence has been imposed by courts in two or more counties, the second or subsequent court must determine the county or counties of incarceration or supervision, including the order of service of such incarceration or supervision. To the extent reasonably possible, the \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": "97 completion of any period of incarceration. In accordance with rule 4.472, the second or subsequent court must calculate the defendant's remaining custody and supervision time.  (7) In making the determination under (a)(6), the court must exercise its discretion after consideration of the following factors:  (A) The relative length of custody or supervision required for each case;  (B) Whether the cases in each county are to be served concurrently or consecutively;  (C) The nature and quality of treatment programs available in each county, if known;  (D) The nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s current enrollment and participation in any treatment program;  (E) The nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s ties to the community, including employment, duration of residence, family attachments, and property holdings;  (F) The nature and extent of supervision available in each county, if known;  (G) The factors listed in rule 4.530(f); and  (H) Any other factor relevant to such determination.  (8) If after the court\u2019s determination in accordance with (a)(6) the defendant is ordered to serve only a custody term without supervision in another county, the defendant must be transported at such time and under such circumstances as the court directs to the county where the custody term is to be served. The defendant must be transported with an abstract of the court\u2019s judgment as required by section 1213(a), or other suitable documentation showing the term imposed by the court and any custody credits against the sentence. The court may order the custody term to be served in another county without also transferring jurisdiction of the case in accordance with rule 4.530.  (9) If after the court\u2019s determination in accordance with (a)(6) the defendant is ordered to serve a period of supervision in another county, whether with or without a term of custody, the matter must be transferred for the period of supervision in accordance with provisions of rule 4.530(f), (g), and (h).

Advisory Committee Comment  The restrictions of (a)(3) do not apply to circumstances where a previously imposed base term is made a consecutive term on resentencing. If the court selects a consecutive sentence structure, and since there can be only one principal term in the final aggregate sentence, if a previously imposed full base term becomes a subordinate consecutive term, the new consecutive term normally will become one-third the middle term by operation of law (section 1170.1(a)).

Determination of presentence custody time credit  At the time of sentencing, the court must cause to be recorded on the judgment or commitment the total time in custody to be credited on the sentence under sections 2900.5, 2933.1(c), 2933.2(c), and 4019. On referral of the defendant to the probation officer for an investigation and report under section 1203(b) or 1203(g), or on setting a date for sentencing in the absence of a referral, the court must direct the sheriff, probation officer, or other appropriate person to report to the court and notify the defendant or defense counsel and prosecuting attorney within a reasonable time before the date set for sentencing as to the number of days that defendant has been in custody and for which he or she may be entitled to credit. Any challenges to the report must be heard at the time of sentencing.

Rule 4.480.  Judge\u2019s statement under section 1203.01  A sentencing judge\u2019s statement of his or her views under section 1203.01 respecting a person sentenced to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Adult Operations is required only in the event that no probation report is filed. Even though it is not required, however, a statement should be submitted by the judge in any case in which  99 he or she believes that the correctional handling and the determination of term and parole should be influenced by information not contained in other court records.  The purpose of a section 1203.01 statement is to provide assistance to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Adult Operations in its programming and institutional assignment and to the Board of Parole Hearings with reference to term fixing and parole release of persons sentenced indeterminately, and parole and postrelease community supervision waiver of persons sentenced determinately. It may amplify any reasons for the sentence that may bear on a possible suggestion by the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or the Board of Parole Hearings that the sentence and commitment be recalled and the defendant be resentenced. To be of maximum assistance to these agencies, a judge\u2019s statements should contain individualized comments concerning the convicted offender, any special circumstances that led to a prison sentence rather than local incarceration, and any other significant information that might not readily be available in any of the accompanying official records and reports.  If a section 1203.01 statement is prepared, it should be submitted no later than two weeks after sentencing so that it may be included in the official Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Adult Operations case summary that is prepared during the time the offender is being processed at the Reception-Guidance Center of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Adult Operations.

(Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Minor convicted of an offense not listed in Welfare and Institutions Code section 602(b) or 707(d) (Penal Code, \u00a7 1170.17)  (1) If the prosecuting attorney lawfully initiated the prosecution as a criminal case and the minor is convicted of an offense not listed in Welfare and Institutions Code section 602(b) or 707(d), but one that would have raised the presumption of unfitness under juvenile court law, the minor may move the court to conduct a postconviction fitness hearing.  (A) On the motion by the minor, the court must order the probation department to prepare a report as required in rule 5.768.  (B) The court may conduct a fitness hearing or remand the matter to the juvenile court for a determination of fitness.

However, if the court and parties agree, the minor may be sentenced in adult court.  (D) If the minor is found unfit, the minor must be sentenced as an adult, unless all parties, including the court, agree that the disposition be conducted under juvenile court law.  (2) If the minor is convicted of an offense not listed in Welfare and Institutions Code section 602(b) or 707(d), but one for which the minor would have been presumed fit under the juvenile court law, the minor must have a disposition hearing under juvenile court law, and consistent with the provisions of Penal Code section 1170.19, either in the trial court or on remand to the juvenile court.  (A) If the prosecuting attorney objects to the treatment of the minor as within the juvenile court law and moves for a fitness hearing to be conducted, the court must order the probation department to prepare a report as required by rule 5.768.  (B) The court may conduct a fitness hearing or remand the matter to the juvenile court for a determination of fitness.  (C) If found to be fit under rule 5.770, the minor will be subject to a disposition hearing under juvenile court law and Penal Code section 1170.19.   101 (D) If the minor is found unfit, the minor must be sentenced as an adult, unless all parties, including the court, agree that the disposition be conducted under juvenile court law.  (3) If the minor is convicted of an offense that would not have permitted a fitness determination, the court must remand the matter to juvenile court for disposition, unless the minor requests sentencing in adult court and all parties, including the court, agree.  (4) Fitness hearings held under this rule must be conducted as provided in title 5, division 3, chapter 14, article 2.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)

(2) If transfer is requested by any other party, the party must first request in writing that the probation officer of the transferring county notice the motion. The party may make the motion to the transferring court only if the probation officer refuses to do so. The probation officer must notify the party of his or her decision within 30 days of the party\u2019s request. Failure by the probation officer to notify the party of his or her decision within 30 days is deemed a refusal to make the motion.  (3) If the party makes the motion, the motion must include a declaration that the probation officer has refused to bring the motion, and the party must provide written notice of the date, time, and place set for hearing on the motion to:  (A) The presiding judge of the receiving court or his or her designee;   (B) The probation officers of the transferring and receiving counties or their designees;   (C) The prosecutor of the transferring county;  (D) The supervised person; and  (E) The supervised person\u2019s last counsel of record (if any).

(Subd (d) amended effective November 1, 2012.)   103 (e) Comment  (1) No later than 10 days before the date set for hearing on the motion, the receiving court may provide comments to the transferring court regarding the proposed transfer.  (2) Any comments provided by the receiving court must be in writing and signed by a judge and must state why transfer is or is not appropriate.   (3) Before deciding a transfer motion, the transferring court must state on the record that it has received and considered any comments provided by the receiving court.  (f) Factors  The transferring court must consider at least the following factors when determining whether transfer is appropriate:  (1) The permanency of the supervised person\u2019s residence. As used in this subdivision, \u201cresidence\u201d means the place where the supervised person customarily lives exclusive of employment, school, or other special or temporary purpose. A supervised person may have only one residence. The fact that the supervised person intends to change residence to the receiving county, without further evidence of how, when, and why this is to be accomplished, is insufficient to transfer supervision;  (2) The availability of appropriate programs for the supervised person, including substance abuse, domestic violence, sex offender, and collaborative court programs;  (3) Restitution orders, including whether transfer would impair the ability of the receiving court to determine a restitution amount or impair the ability of the victim to collect court-ordered restitution; and   (4) Victim issues, including:   (A) The residence and places frequented by the victim, including school and workplace; and   (B) Whether transfer would impair the ability of the court, law enforcement, or the probation officer of the transferring county to properly enforce protective orders.  (Subd (f) amended effective November 1, 2012.)  (g) Transfer   104 (1) If the transferring court determines that the permanent residence of the supervised person is in the county of the receiving court, the transferring court must transfer the case unless it determines that transfer would be inappropriate and states its reasons on the record.  (2) To the extent possible, the transferring court must establish any amount of restitution owed by the supervised person before it orders the transfer.  (3) Transfer is effective the date the transferring court orders the transfer . Upon transfer of the case, the receiving court must accept the entire jurisdiction over the case.   (4) The orders for transfer must include an order committing the supervised person to the care and custody of the probation officer of the receiving county.  (5) Upon transfer of the case, the transferring court must transmit the entire original court file to the receiving court in all cases in which the supervisee is the sole defendant, except the transferring court shall not transfer (A) exhibits or (B) any records of payments. If transfer is ordered in a case involving more than one defendant, the transferring court must transmit certified copies of the entire original court file, except exhibits and any records of payments, to the receiving court upon transfer of the case.   (6) A certified copy of the entire court file may be electronically transmitted if an original paper court file does not exist. Upon receipt of an electronically transmitted certified copy of the entire court file from the transferring court, the receiving court must deem it an original file.  (7) Upon transfer the probation officer of the transferring county must transmit, at a minimum, any court orders, probation or mandatory supervision reports, and case plans to the probation officer of the receiving county.  (8) Upon transfer of the case, the probation officer of the transferring county must notify the supervised person of the transfer order. The supervised person must report to the probation officer of the receiving county no later than 30 days after transfer unless the transferring court orders the supervised person to report sooner. If the supervised person is in custody at the time of transfer, the supervised person must report to the probation officer of the receiving county no later than 30 days after being released from custody unless the transferring court orders the supervised person to report sooner. Any jail sentence imposed as a condition of probation or mandatory supervision prior to transfer must be served in the transferring county unless otherwise authorized by law.   105 (9) Upon transfer of the case, only the receiving court may certify copies from the case file.

(h) Court-ordered debt  (1) In accordance with Penal Code section 1203.9(d) and (e):   (A) If the transferring court has ordered the defendant to pay fines, fees, forfeitures, penalties, assessments, or restitution, the transfer order must require that those and any other amounts ordered by the transferring court that are still unpaid at the time of transfer be paid by the defendant to the collection program for the transferring court for proper distribution and accounting once collected.   (B) The receiving court and receiving county probation department may not impose additional local fees and costs.  (C) Upon approval of a transferring court, a receiving court may elect to collect all of the court-ordered payments from a defendant attributable to the case under which the defendant is being supervised.   (2) Policies and procedures for implementation of the collection, accounting, and disbursement of court-ordered debt under this rule must be consistent with Judicial Council fiscal procedures available at www.courts.ca.gov .

Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivision (g)(5) requires the transferring court to transmit the entire original court file, except exhibits and any records of payments, to the court of the receiving county in all cases in which the supervisee is the sole defendant. Before transmitting the entire original court file, transferring courts should consider retaining copies of the court file in the event of an appeal or a writ. In cases involving more than one defendant, subdivision (g)(5) requires the transferring court to transmit certified copies of the entire original court file to ensure that transferring courts are able to properly adjudicate any pending or future codefendant proceedings. Only documents related to the transferring defendant must be transmitted to the receiving court.  Subdivision (g)(7) clarifies that any jail sentence imposed as a condition of probation or mandatory supervision before transfer must be served in the transferring county unless otherwise authorized by law. For example, Penal Code section 1208.5 authorizes the boards of supervisors of two or more counties with work furlough programs to enter into agreements to allow work- 106 furlough-eligible persons sentenced to or imprisoned in one county jail to transfer to another county jail.  Subdivision (h) requires defendants still owing fines, fees, forfeitures, penalties, assessments, or restitution to pay the transferring court\u2019s collection program. In counties where the county probation department collects this court-ordered debt, the term \u201ccollection program\u201d is intended to include the county probation department.    Chapter 2.

Rule 4.550 amended effective April 25, 2019; adopted effective January 1, 2002; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.  Rule 4.551.  Habeas corpus proceedings   110 (a) Petition; form and court ruling   (1) Except as provided in (2), the petition must be on the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus  (form HC-001).  (2) For good cause, a court may also accept for filing a petition that does not comply with (a)(1). A petition submitted by an attorney need not be on the Judicial Council form. However, a petition that is not on the Judicial Council form must comply with Penal Code section 1474 and must contain the pertinent information specified in the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus  (form HC-001), including the information required regarding other petitions, motions, or applications filed in any court with respect to the conviction, commitment, or issue.  (3) (A) On filing, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver the petition to the presiding judge or his or her designee. The court must rule on a petition for writ of habeas corpus within 60 days after the petition is filed.  (B) If the court fails to rule on the petition within 60 days of its filing, the petitioner may file a notice and request for ruling.  (i) The petitioner\u2019s notice and request for ruling must include a declaration stating the date the petition was filed and the date of the notice and request for ruling, and indicating that the petitioner has not received a ruling on the petition. A copy of the original petition must be attached to the notice and request for ruling.  (ii) If the presiding judge or his or her designee determines that the notice is complete and the court has failed to rule, the presiding judge or his or her designee must assign the petition to a judge and calendar the matter for a decision without appearances within 30 days of the filing of the notice and request for ruling. If the judge assigned by the presiding judge rules on the petition before the date the petition is calendared for decision, the matter may be taken off calendar.  (4) For the purposes of (a)(3), the court rules on the petition by:  (A) Issuing an order to show cause under (c);  (B) Denying the petition for writ of habeas corpus; or  (C) Requesting an informal response to the petition for writ of habeas corpus under (b).  111  (5) The court must issue an order to show cause or deny the petition within 45 days after receipt of an informal response requested under (b).  (Subd (a) amended effective January 22, 2019; previously amended effective January 1, 2002, January 1, 2004, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2009.)  (b) Informal response   (1) Before passing on the petition, the court may request an informal response from:  (A) The respondent or real party in interest; or  (B) The custodian of any record pertaining to the petitioner\u2019s case, directing the custodian to produce the record or a certified copy to be filed with the clerk of the court.  (2) A copy of the request must be sent to the petitioner. The informal response, if any, must be served on the petitioner by the party of whom the request is made. The informal response must be in writing and must be served and filed within 15 days. If any informal response is filed, the court must notify the petitioner that he or she may reply to the informal response within 15 days from the date of service of the response on the petitioner. If the informal response consists of records or copies of records, a copy of every record and document furnished to the court must be furnished to the petitioner.  (3) After receiving an informal response, the court may not deny the petition until the petitioner has filed a timely reply to the informal response or the 15-day period provided for a reply under (b)(2) has expired.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted effective January 1, 2002.)  (c) Order to show cause   (1) The court must issue an order to show cause if the petitioner has made a prima facie showing that he or she is entitled to relief. In doing so, the court takes petitioner\u2019s factual allegations as true and makes a preliminary assessment regarding whether the petitioner would be entitled to relief if his or her factual allegations were proved. If so, the court must issue an order to show cause.  (2) On issuing an order to show cause, the court must appoint counsel for any unrepresented petitioner who desires but cannot afford counsel.    112 (3) An order to show cause is a determination that the petitioner has made a showing that he or she may be entitled to relief. It does not grant the relief sought in the petition.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted effective January 1, 2002.)  (d) Return   If an order to show cause is issued as provided in (c), the respondent may, within 30 days thereafter, file a return. Any material allegation of the petition not controverted by the return is deemed admitted for purposes of the proceeding. The return must comply with Penal Code section 1480 and must be served on the petitioner.  (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2007; repealed and adopted effective January 1, 2002; previously amended effective January 1, 2004.)  (e) Denial   Within 30 days after service and filing of a return, the petitioner may file a denial. Any material allegation of the return not denied is deemed admitted for purposes of the proceeding. Any denial must comply with Penal Code section 1484 and must be served on the respondent.  (Subd (e) amended and relettered effective January 1, 2002; adopted as subd (b) effective January 1, 1982.)  (f) Evidentiary hearing; when required   Within 30 days after the filing of any denial or, if none is filed, after the expiration of the time for filing a denial, the court must either grant or deny the relief sought by the petition or order an evidentiary hearing. An evidentiary hearing is required if, after considering the verified petition, the return, any denial, any affidavits or declarations under penalty of perjury, and matters of which judicial notice may be \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}

(Subd (f) amended and relettered effective January 1, 2002; adopted as subd (c) effective January 1, 1982.)  (g) Reasons for denial of petition   Any order denying a petition for writ of habeas corpus must contain a brief statement of the reasons for the denial.

Advisory Committee Comment   The court must appoint counsel on the issuance of an order to show cause. ( In re Clark  (1993) 5 Cal.4th 750, 780 and People v. Shipman (1965) 62 Cal.2d 226, 231\u2013232.) The Court of Appeal has held that under Penal Code section 987.2, counties bear the expense of appointed counsel in a habeas corpus proceeding challenging the underlying conviction. ( Charlton v. Superior Court (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 858, 862.) Penal Code section 987.2 authorizes appointment of the public defender, or private counsel if there is no public defender available, for indigents in criminal proceedings.   Rule 4.552.  Habeas corpus jurisdiction  (a) Proper court to hear petition   Except as stated in (b), the petition should be heard and resolved in the court in which it is filed.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2012; previously amended effective January 1, 2006, and January 1, 2007.)  (b) Transfer of petition  (1) The superior court in which the petition is filed must determine, based on the allegations of the petition, whether the matter should be heard by it or in the superior court of another county.  (2) If the superior court in which the petition is filed determines that the matter may be more properly heard by the superior court of another county, it may nonetheless retain jurisdiction in the matter or, without first determining  114 whether a prima facie case for relief exists, order the matter transferred to the other county. Transfer may be ordered in the following circumstances:  (A) If the petition challenges the terms of a judgment, the matter may be transferred to the county in which judgment was rendered.  (B) If the petition challenges the conditions of an inmate\u2019s confinement, it may be transferred to the county in which the petitioner is confined. A change in the institution of confinement that effects a change in the conditions of confinement may constitute good cause to deny the petition.  (C) If the petition challenges the denial of parole or the petitioner\u2019s suitability for parole and is filed in a superior court other than the court that rendered the underlying judgment, the court in which the petition is filed should transfer the petition to the superior court in which the underlying judgment was rendered.  (3) The transferring court must specify in the order of transfer the reason for the transfer.  (4) If the receiving court determines that the reason for transfer is inapplicable, the receiving court must, within 30 days of receipt of the case, order the case returned to the transferring court. The transferring court must retain and resolve the matter as provided by these rules.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2012; previously amended effective January 1, 2006.)  (c) Single judge must decide petition   A petition for writ of habeas corpus filed in the superior court must be decided by a single judge; it must not be considered by the appellate division of the superior court.

Advisory Committee Comment   Subdivision (b)(2)(C). This subdivision is based on the California Supreme Court decision in In re Roberts  (2005) 36 Cal.4th 575, which provides that petitions for writ of habeas corpus challenging denial or suitability for parole should first be adjudicated in the trial court that rendered the underlying judgment.   115 Article 3.

Application of article  This article governs procedures for death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus proceedings in the superior courts.  Rule 4.560 adopted effective April 25, 2019.  Rule 4.561.  Superior court appointment of counsel in death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus proceedings  (a) Purpose  This rule, in conjunction with rule 4.562, establishes a mechanism for superior courts to appoint qualified counsel to represent indigent persons in death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus proceedings. This rule governs the appointment of counsel by superior courts only, including when the Supreme Court or a Court of Appeal has transferred a habeas corpus petition without having appointed counsel for the petitioner. It does not govern the appointment of counsel by the Supreme Court or a Court of Appeal.  (b) Prioritization of oldest judgments  In the interest of equity, both to the families of victims and to persons sentenced to death, California courts, whenever possible, should appoint death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus counsel first for those persons subject to the oldest judgments of death.  (c) List of persons subject to a judgment of death  The Habeas Corpus Resource Center must maintain a list of persons subject to a judgment of death, organized by the date the judgment was entered by the sentencing court. The list must indicate whether death penalty\u2013related habeas  116 corpus counsel has been appointed for each person and, if so, the date of the appointment. The list must also indicate for each person whether a petition is pending in the Supreme Court.  (d) Notice of oldest judgments without counsel  (1) Within 30 days of the effective date of this rule, the Habeas Corpus Resource Center must identify the persons on the list required by (c) with the 25 oldest judgments of death for whom death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus counsel have not been appointed.  (2) The Habeas Corpus Resource Center must notify the presiding judges of the superior courts in which these 25 judgments of death were entered that these are the oldest cases in which habeas corpus counsel have not been appointed. The Habeas Corpus Resource Center will send a copy of the notice to the administrative presiding justice of the appellate district in which the superior court is located.  (3) The presiding judge must identify the appropriate judge within the court to make an appointment and notify the judge that the case is among the oldest cases in which habeas corpus appointments are to be made.  (4) If qualified counsel is available for appointment to a case for which a petition is pending in the Supreme Court, the judge must provide written notice to the Supreme Court that counsel is available for appointment.  (5) On entry of an order appointing death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus counsel, the appointing court must promptly send a copy of the appointment order to the Habeas Corpus Resource Center, which must update the list to reflect that counsel was appointed, and to the clerk/executive officer of the Supreme Court, the Attorney General, and the district attorney. The court must also send notice to the Habeas Corpus Resource Center, clerk/executive officer of the Supreme Court, Attorney General, and district attorney if, for any reason, the court determines that it does not need to make an appointment.  (6) When a copy of an appointment order, or information indicating that an appointment is for any reason not required, has been received by the Habeas Corpus Resource Center for 20 judgments, the center will identify the next 20 oldest judgments of death in cases in which death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus counsel have not been appointed and send out a notice identifying these 20 judgments, and the procedures required by paragraphs (3) through (6) of this subdivision must be repeated.  (7) The presiding judge of a superior court may designate another judge within the court to carry out his or her duties in this subdivision.   117 (e) Appointment of counsel  (1) After the court receives a notice under (d)(2) and has made the findings required by Government Code section 68662, the appropriate judge must appoint a qualified attorney or attorneys to represent the person in death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus proceedings.  (2) The superior court must appoint an attorney or attorneys from the statewide panel of counsel compiled under rule 4.562(d)(4); an entity that employs qualified attorneys, including the Habeas Corpus Resource Center, the local public defender\u2019s office, or alternate public defender\u2019s office; or if the court has adopted a local rule under 4.562(g), an attorney determined to be qualified under that court\u2019s local rules. The court must at this time also designate an assisting entity or counsel, unless the appointed counsel is employed by the Habeas Corpus Resource Center.  (3) When the court appoints counsel to represent a person in a death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus proceeding under this subdivision, the court must complete and enter an Order Appointing Counsel in Death Penalty\u2013Related Habeas Corpus Proceeding  (form HC-101).  Rule 4.561 adopted effective April 25, 2019.  Rule 4.562.  Recruitment and determination of qualifications of attorneys for appointment in death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus proceedings   (a) Purpose  This rule provides for a panel of attorneys from which superior courts may appoint counsel in death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus proceedings.  (b) Regional habeas corpus panel committees  Each Court of Appeal must establish a death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus panel committee as provided in this rule.  (c) Composition of regional habeas corpus panel committees  (1) The administrative presiding justice of the Court of Appeal appoints the \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": " (A) One justice of the Court of Appeal to serve as the chair of the committee;  (B) A total of three judges from among those nominated by the presiding judges of the superior courts located within the appellate district; and   118 (C) A total of three attorneys from among those nominated by the entities in the six categories below. At least two of those appointed must have experience representing a petitioner in a death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus proceeding.  (i) An attorney nominated by the Habeas Corpus Resource Center;  (ii) An attorney nominated by the California Appellate Project\u2013San Francisco;  (iii) An attorney nominated by the appellate project with which the Court of Appeal contracts;  (iv) An attorney nominated by any of the federal public defenders\u2019 offices of the federal districts in which the participating courts are located;  (v) An attorney nominated by any of the public defenders\u2019 offices in a county where the participating courts are located; and  (vi) An attorney nominated by any entity not listed in this subparagraph, if the administrative presiding justice requests such a nomination.  (2) Each committee may also include advisory members, as authorized by the administrative presiding justice.  (3) The term of the chair and committee members is three years. Terms are staggered so that an approximately equal number of each committee\u2019s members changes annually. The administrative presiding justice has the discretion to remove or replace a chair or committee member for any reason.  (4) Except as otherwise provided in this rule, each committee is authorized to establish the procedures under which it is governed.  (d) Regional habeas corpus panel committee responsibilities  The committee has the following responsibilities:  (1) Support superior court efforts to recruit applicants  Each committee must assist the participating superior courts in their efforts to recruit attorneys to represent indigent petitioners in death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus proceedings in the superior courts.  (2) Accept applications   119  Each committee must accept applications from attorneys who seek to be included on the panel of attorneys qualified for appointment in death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus proceedings in the superior courts.  (A) The application must be on a Declaration of Counsel re Minimum Qualifications for Appointment in Death Penalty\u2013Related Habeas Corpus Proceedings  (form HC-100).  (B) Except as provided in (C), each committee must accept applications from attorneys whose principal place of business is within the appellate district and from only those attorneys.  (C) In addition to accepting applications from attorneys whose principal place of business is in its district, the First Appellate District committee must also accept applications from attorneys whose principal place of business is outside the state.  (3) Review qualifications   Each committee must review the applications it receives and determine whether the applicant meets the minimum qualifications stated in this division to represent persons in death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus proceedings in the superior courts.  (4) Provide names of qualified counsel for statewide panel   (A) If a committee determines by a majority vote that an attorney is qualified to represent persons in death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus proceedings in the superior court, it must include the name of the attorney on a statewide panel of qualified attorneys.  (B) Committees will provide to the Habeas Corpus Resource Center the names of attorneys who the committees determine meet the minimum qualifications. The Habeas Corpus Resource Center must consolidate the names into a single statewide panel, update the names on the panel at least quarterly, and make the most current panel available to superior courts on its website.  (C) Unless removed from the panel under (d)(6), an attorney included on the panel may remain on the panel for up to six years without submitting a renewed application.  (D) Inclusion on the statewide panel does not entitle an attorney to appointment by a superior court, nor does it compel an attorney to accept an appointment.  120  (5) Match qualified attorneys to cases   Each committee must assist a participating superior court in matching one or more qualified attorneys from the statewide panel to a person for whom counsel must be appointed under Government Code section 68662, if the court requests such assistance.  (6) Remove attorneys from panel   Suspension or disbarment of an attorney will result in removal of the attorney from the panel. Other disciplinary action, or a finding that counsel has provided ineffective assistance of counsel, may result in a reevaluation of the attorney\u2019s inclusion on the panel by the committee that initially determined the attorney to have met minimum qualifications.  (e) Consolidated habeas corpus panel committees  The administrative presiding justices of two or more Courts of Appeal may elect, following consultation with the presiding judges of the superior courts within their respective appellate districts, to operate a single committee to collectively fulfill the committee responsibilities for the superior courts in their appellate districts.  (f) Recruitment of qualified attorneys  The superior courts in which a judgment of death has been entered against an indigent person for whom habeas corpus counsel has not been appointed must develop and implement a plan to identify and recruit qualified counsel who may apply to be appointed.  (g) Local rule  A superior court may, by adopting a local rule, authorize appointment of qualified attorneys who are not members of the statewide panel. The local rule must establish procedures for submission and review of a Declaration of Counsel re Minimum Qualifications for Appointment in Death Penalty\u2013Related Habeas Corpus Proceedings  (form HC-100) and require attorneys to meet the minimum qualifications under rule 8.652(c).  Rule 4.562 adopted effective April 25, 2019.  Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivisions (d) and (f). In addition to the responsibilities identified in subdivisions (d) and (f), courts and regional committees are encouraged to support activities to expand the pool of attorneys that are qualified to represent petitioners in death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus  121 proceedings. Examples of such activities include providing mentoring and training programs and encouraging the use of supervised counsel.   Rule 4.571.  Filing of petition in the superior court  (a) Petition  (1) A petition and supporting memorandum must comply with this rule and, except as otherwise provided in this rule, with rules 2.100\u20132.117 relating to the form of papers.

(4) If any supporting documents have previously been filed in the same superior court in which the petition is filed and the petition so states and identifies the documents by case number, filing date and title of the document, copies of these documents need not be included in the supporting documents.  (5) Rule 8.486(c)(1) governs the form of any supporting documents accompanying the petition.  (6) If any supporting documents accompanying the petition or any subsequently filed paper are sealed, rules 2.550 and 2.551 govern. Notwithstanding rule 8.45(a), if any supporting documents accompanying the petition or any subsequently filed papers are confidential records, rules 8.45(b), (c), and 8.47  122 govern, except that rules 2.550 and 2.551 govern the procedures for making a motion or application to seal such records.  (7) When other laws establish specific requirements for particular types of sealed or confidential records that differ from the requirements in this subdivision, those specific requirements supersede the requirements in this subdivision.

Rule 5.83.  Family Centered Case Resolution  Rule 5.83.  Family centered case resolution  (a) Purpose  This rule establishes processes and procedures for courts to manage cases from initial filing to final disposition in an effective and timely manner. It is intended to advance the goals of Family Code section 2450(a) and Standards of Judicial Administration, standard 5.30.  (b) Definitions  (1) \u201cFamily centered case resolution process\u201d refers to the process employed by the court to ensure that family law cases move through the court process from filing to final disposition in a timely, fair, and effective manner.  (2) \u201cDisposition\u201d refers to final judgment, dismissal, change of venue, or consolidation of the case into a lead case. Courts may continue a case in, or return a case to, the family centered case resolution process after disposition.   31 (3) \u201cStatus conference\u201d refers to court events scheduled with the parties and attorneys for the purpose of identifying the current status of the case and determining the next steps required to reach disposition.  (4) \u201cFamily centered case resolution conference\u201d refers to a conference scheduled with parties, attorneys, and a judicial officer to develop and implement a family centered case resolution plan under Family Code section 2451.  (c) Family centered case resolution process  (1) Beginning January 1, 2012, courts must develop a family centered case resolution process which must be fully implemented by January 1, 2013. The family centered case resolution process must identify and assist all dissolution, legal separation, nullity, and parentage cases to progress through the court process toward disposition effectively in a timely manner. The court may identify other family law case types to include in the family centered case resolution process.  (2) For cases filed on or after January 1, 2013, the court must include as part of the family centered case resolution process a review of all dissolution, legal separation, nullity, and parentage cases within at least 180 days from the date of the initial filing and at a minimum, at least every 180 days thereafter until disposition in order to determine the most appropriate next steps to help ensure an effective, fair, and timely resolution. Unless the court determines that procedural milestones are being met, the review must include at least one \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": "resolution conference. Nothing in this section prohibits courts from setting more frequent review dates.  (3) If, after 18 months from the date the petition was filed, both parties have failed to participate in the case resolution process as determined by the court, the court\u2019s obligation for further review of the case is relieved until the case qualifies for dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.210 or 583.310, or until the parties reactivate participation in the case, and the case is not counted toward the goals for disposition set out in (c)(5).  (4) In deciding whether a case is progressing in an effective and timely manner, the court should consider procedural milestones including the following:  (A) A proof of service of summons and petition should be filed within 60 days of case initiation;   32 (B) If no response has been filed, and the parties have not agreed on an extension of time to respond, a request to enter default should be submitted within 60 days after the date the response was due;  (C) The petitioner\u2019s preliminary declaration of disclosure should be served within 60 days of the filing of the petition;  (D) When a default has been entered, a judgment should be submitted within 60 days of the entry of default;  (E) Whether a trial date has been requested or scheduled; and  (F) When the parties have notified the court that they are actively negotiating or mediating their case, a written agreement for judgment is submitted within six months of the date the petition was filed, or a request for trial date is submitted.  (5) For dissolution, legal separation, and nullity cases initially filed on or after January 1, 2014, the goals of any family centered case resolution process should be to finalize dispositions as follows:  (A) At least 20 percent are disposed within 6 months from the date the petition was filed;  (B) At least 75 percent are disposed within 12 months from the date the petition was filed; and  (C) At least 90 percent are disposed within 18 months from the date the petition was filed.  (6) The court may select various procedural milestones at which to assist cases in moving toward disposition in an effective and timely manner. Types of assistance that can be provided include the following:  (A) Notifying the parties and attorneys by mail, telephone, e-mail, or other electronic method of communication of the current status of the case and the next procedural steps required to reach disposition;  (B) Implementing a schedule of status conferences for cases to identify the status of the case and determine the next steps required to progress toward disposition;   33 (C) Providing assistance to the parties at the time scheduled for hearings on requests for orders to identify the status of the case and determine the next steps required to reach disposition;  (D) Providing financial and property settlement opportunities to the parties and their attorneys with judicial officers or qualified attorney settlement officers;  (E) Scheduling a family centered case resolution conference to develop and implement a family centered case resolution plan under Family Code section 2451.  (7) In deciding that a case requires a family centered case resolution conference, the court should consider, in addition to procedural milestones, factors including the following:  (A) Difficulty in locating  and serving the respondent;  (B) Complexity of issues;  (C) Nature and extent of anticipated discovery;  (D) Number and locations of percipient and expert witnesses;  (E) Estimated length of trial;  (F) Statutory priority for issues such as custody and visitation of minor children;  (G) Extent of property and support issues in controversy;  (H) Existence of issues of domestic violence, child abuse, or substance abuse;  (I) Pendency of other actions or proceedings that may affect the case; and  (J) Any other factor that would affect the time for disposition.  (d) Family centered case resolution conferences  (1) The court may hold an initial family centered case resolution conference to develop a specific case resolution plan. The conference is not intended to be an evidentiary hearing.  34  (2) Family centered case resolution conferences must be heard by a judicial officer. On the court\u2019s initiative or at the request of the parties, to enhance access to the court, the conference may be held in person, by telephone, by videoconferencing, or by other appropriate means of communication.  (3) At the conference, counsel for each party and each self-represented litigant must be familiar with the case and must be prepared to discuss the party\u2019s positions on the issues.  (4) With the exception of mandatory child custody mediation and mandatory settlement conferences, before alternative dispute resolution (ADR) is included in a family centered case resolution plan under Family Code section 2451(a)(2), the court must inform the parties that their participation in any court recommended ADR services is voluntary and that ADR services can be part of a plan only if both parties voluntarily opt to use these services. Additionally, the court must:  (A) Inform the parties that ADR may not be appropriate in cases involving domestic violence and provide information about separate sessions; and  (B) Ensure that all court-connected providers of ADR services that are part of a family centered case resolution plan have been trained in assessing and handling cases that may involve domestic violence.  (5) Nothing in this rule prohibits an employee of the court from reviewing the file and notifying the parties of any deficiencies in their paperwork before the parties appear in front of a judicial officer at a family centered case resolution conference. This type of assistance can occur by telephone, in person, in writing, or by other means approved by the court, on or before each scheduled family centered case resolution conference. However, this type of procedural assistance is not intended to replace family centered case resolution plan management or to create a barrier to litigants\u2019 access to a judicial officer.  (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2016.)  (e) Family centered case resolution plan order  (1) Family centered case resolution plans as ordered by the court must comply with Family Code sections 2450(b) and 2451.   35 (2) The family centered case resolution plan order should set a schedule for subsequent family centered case resolution conferences and otherwise provide for management of the case.  (f) Family centered case resolution order without appearance  If the court determines that appearances at a family centered case resolution conference are not necessary, the court may notify the parties and, if stipulated, issue a family centered case resolution order without an appearance at a conference.  (g) Family centered case resolution information  (1) Upon the filing of first papers in dissolution, legal separation, nullity, or parentage actions the court must provide the filing party with the following:  (A) Written information summarizing the process of a case through disposition;  (B) A list of local resources that offer procedural assistance, legal advice or information, settlement opportunities, and domestic violence services;  (C) Instructions for keeping the court informed of the person\u2019s current address and phone number, and e-mail address;  (D) Information for self-represented parties about the opportunity to meet with court self-help center staff or a family law facilitator; and  (E) Information for litigants on how to request a status conference, or a family centered case resolution conference earlier than or in addition to, any status conference or family centered case resolution conferences scheduled by the court.

If the fees are not paid within the time specified in section 399(a), the court may, on a duly  48 noticed motion by any party or on its own motion, dismiss the action without prejudice to the cause of action. Except as provided in (e), no other action on the cause may be commenced in another court before satisfaction of the court\u2019s order for fees and costs or a court-ordered waiver of such fees and costs.   (2) If a transfer of jurisdiction is ordered by the court on its own motion, the court must specify in its order which party is responsible for the Government Code section 70618 fees. If that party has not paid the fees within five days of service of notice of the transfer order, any other party interested in the action or proceeding may pay the costs and fees and the clerk must transmit the case file. If the fees are not paid within the time period set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 399, the court may, on a duly noticed motion by any party or on its own motion, dismiss the action without prejudice to the cause or enter such other orders as the court deems appropriate. Except as provided in (e), no other action on the cause may be commenced in the original court or another court before satisfaction of the court\u2019s order for fees and costs or a court-ordered waiver of such fees and costs.

If a partial fee waiver has been granted, the party responsible for the fees and costs must pay the required portion of the fees and costs before the case will be transmitted. In any case involving a fee waiver, the court receiving the case file has the authority under Government Code section 68636 to review the party\u2019s eligibility for a fee waiver based on additional information available to the court or pursuant to a hearing at final disposition of the case.   (4) At the hearing to transfer jurisdiction, the court must address any issues regarding fees. If a litigant indicates they cannot afford to pay the fees, a fee waiver request form should be provided by the clerk and the court should promptly rule on that request.  (c) Time frame for transfer of jurisdiction After a court orders the transfer of jurisdiction over the action or proceeding, the clerk must transmit the case file to the clerk of the court to which the action or proceeding is transferred within five court days of the date of expiration of the 20-\n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}

This rule does not apply in cases filed under the Domestic Violence Prevention Act.  (b) Service of temporary emergency orders  If the judicial officer signs the applicant\u2019s proposed emergency orders, the applicant must obtain and have the conformed copy of the orders personally served on all parties.

(2) Intake form   Any intake form that an agency charged with providing family court services requires the parties to complete before the commencement of mediation or evaluation must state that, if a party alleging domestic violence in a written declaration under penalty of perjury or a party protected by a protective order so requests, the Family Court Services staff must meet with the parties separately and at separate times.  (3) Review of intake form and case file   All Family Court Services procedures must be conducted in accordance with state law and must include review of intake forms and court files, when available, by appropriate staff.  (f) Screening  (1) Identification of domestic violence   Screening for a history of domestic violence incidents must be done throughout the Family Court Services process.

Screening techniques may include but are not limited to questionnaires, telephone interviews, standardized screening devices, and face-to-face interviews.  (2) Procedures for identification   Procedures for identifying domestic violence may include, but are not limited to: (a) determination of an existing emergency protective order or domestic violence restraining order concerning the parties or minor; (b) review of court papers and declarations; (c) telephone interviews; (d) use of an intake form; (e) orientation; (f) information from attorneys, shelters, hospital reports, Child Protective Services, police reports, and criminal background checks; and (g) other collateral sources.

(g) Safety issues  (1) Developing a safety plan   When domestic violence is identified or alleged in a case, Family Court Services staff must consult with the party alleging domestic violence away from the presence of the party against whom such allegations are made and discuss the existence of or need for a safety plan. Safety planning may include but is not limited to discussion of safe housing, workplace safety, safety for other family members and children, access to financial resources, and information about local domestic violence agencies.  (2) Safety procedures   Each Family Court Services office should develop safety procedures for handling domestic violence cases.  (3) Confidential addresses   Where appropriate, Family Court Services staff must make reasonable efforts to keep residential addresses, work addresses, and contact information\u2014including but not limited to telephone numbers and e-mail addresses\u2014confidential in all cases and on all Family Court Services documents.

(2) Excluding support person   A Family Court Services staff person may exclude a domestic violence support person from a mediation session if the support person participates in the mediation session or acts as an advocate or the presence of a particular support person disrupts the process of mediation. The presence of the support person does not waive the confidentiality of the process, and the support person is bound by the confidentiality of the process.  (Subd (h) amended effective January 1, 2003.)  (i) Accessibility of services  To effectively address domestic violence cases, the court must make reasonable efforts to ensure the availability of safe and accessible services that include, but are not limited to:  (1) Language accessibility  Whenever possible, Family Court Services programs should be conducted in the languages of all participants, including those who are deaf. When the participants use only a language other than spoken English and the Family Court Services staff person does not speak their language, an interpreter\u2014certified whenever possible\u2014should be assigned to interpret at the session. A minor child of the parties must not be used as an interpreter. An adult family member may act as an interpreter only when appropriate interpreters are not available. When a family member is acting as an interpreter, Family Court Services staff should attempt to establish, away from the presence of the potential interpreter and the other party, whether the person alleging domestic violence is comfortable with having that family member interpret for the parties.  (2) Facilities design    81 To minimize contact between the parties and promote safety in domestic violence cases, courts must give consideration to the design of facilities. Such considerations must include but are not limited to the following: separate and secure waiting areas, separate conference rooms for parent education and mediation, signs providing directions to Family Court Services, and secure parking for users of Family Court Services.  (j) Training and education  (1) Training, continuing education, and experience requirements for Family Court Services staff   All Family Court Services staff must participate in programs of continuing instruction in issues related to domestic violence, including child abuse, as may be arranged for and provided to them, under Family Code section 1816(a).

Those staff members employed by Family Court Services on January 1, 2002, who have not already fulfilled the requirements of rule 5.230 must participate in the 16-hour training within one year of the rule\u2019s effective date.  (3) Support staff   Family Court Services programs should, where possible, enable support staff, including but not limited to clerical staff, to participate in training on domestic violence and in handling domestic violence cases appropriately.

Article 5.  Children\u2019s Participation in Family Court Title 5, Family and Juvenile Rules\u2014Division 1, Family Rules\u2014Chapter 8, Child Custody and Visitation (Parenting Time) Proceedings\u2014Article 5, Children\u2019s Participation in Family Court; adopted January 1, 2013.  Rule 5.250.  Children\u2019s participation and testimony in family court proceedings  (a) Authority and overview  This rule is intended to implement Family Code section 3042. No statutory mandate, rule, or practice requires children to participate in court or prohibits them from doing so.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2023.)  (b) Children\u2019s participation   When a child wishes to participate in a court proceeding involving child custody and visitation (parenting time):  (1) The court should find a balance between protecting the child, the statutory duty to consider the wishes of and input from the child, and the probative value of the child\u2019s input while ensuring all parties\u2019 due process rights to be aware of and to challenge evidence relied on by the court in making custody decisions.  (2) The court must:   (A) Consider a child\u2019s participation in family law matters on a case-by-case basis; and  124  (B) Not permit a child addressing the court about child custody or visitation (parenting time) to do so in the presence of the parties. The court must provide an alternative to having the child address the court in the presence of the parties to obtain input directly from the child.  (3) Notwithstanding the prohibition in (b)(2)(B), the court:  (A) May permit the child addressing the court about child custody or visitation (parenting time) to do so in the presence of the parties if the court determines that doing so is in the child\u2019s best interests and states its reasons for that finding on the record; and   (B) Must, in determining the best interests of the child under (b)(2)(A), consider whether addressing the court regarding child custody or visitation (parenting time) in the presence of the parties is likely to be detrimental to the child.   (Subd (b) adopted effective January 1, 2023.)  (c) Determining if the child wishes to address, or has changed their choice about addressing, the court  (1) The following persons must notify the persons in (c)(2) if they have information indicating that a child in a custody or visitation (parenting time) matter either wishes to address the court or has changed their choice about addressing the court:  (A) An attorney appointed to represent the child in the case;  (B) An evaluator;  (C) An investigator;  (D) A child custody recommending counselor who provides recommendations to the judicial officer under Family Code section 3183; and  (E) Other professionals serving on the case.  (2) The notice described in (c)(1) must be given, as soon as feasible, to the following:    125 (A) The parties or their attorneys;  (B) The attorney appointed to represent the child;  (C) Other professionals serving on the case; and then  (D) The judicial officer.  (3) The following persons may inform the court if they have information indicating that a child wishes to address the court:  (A) A party; and  (B) A party\u2019s attorney.  (4) In the absence of information indicating a child wishes to address the court, the judicial officer may inquire whether the child wishes to do so.  (Subd (c) relettered and amended effective January 1, 2023; adopted as subd (b).)  (d) Guidelines for determining whether addressing the court is in the child\u2019s best interest  (1) When a child indicates that he or she wishes to address the court, the judicial officer must consider whether involving the child in the proceedings is in the child\u2019s best interest.  (2) If the child indicating an interest in addressing the court is 14 years old or older, the judicial officer must hear from that child unless the court makes a finding that addressing the court is not in the child\u2019s best interest and states the reasons on the record.  (3) In determining whether addressing the court is in a child\u2019s best interest, the judicial officer should consider the following:  (A) Whether the child is of sufficient age and capacity to reason to form an intelligent preference as to custody or visitation (parenting time);  (B) Whether the child is of sufficient age and capacity to understand the nature of testimony;  (C) Whether information has been presented indicating that the child may be at risk emotionally if he or she is permitted or denied the opportunity  126 to address the court or that the child may benefit from addressing the court;  (D) Whether the subject areas about which the child is anticipated to address the court are relevant to the court\u2019s decisionmaking process; and  (E) Whether any other factors weigh in favor of or against having the child address the court, taking into consideration the child\u2019s desire to do so.  (Subd (d) relettered effective January 1, 2023; adopted as subd (c).)  (e) Guidelines for receiving testimony and other input  (1) If the court precludes the calling of a child as a witness, alternatives for the court to obtain information or other input from the child may include, but are not limited to:  (A) The child\u2019s participation in child custody mediation under Family Code section 3180;  (B) Appointment of a child custody evaluator or investigator under Family Code section 3110 or Evidence Code section 730;  (C) Admissible evidence provided by the parents, parties, or witnesses in the proceeding;  (D) Information provided by a child custody recommending counselor authorized to provide recommendations under Family Code section 3183(a); and  (E) Information provided from a child interview center or professional so as to avoid unnecessary multiple interviews.  (2) If the court precludes the calling of a child as a witness and specifies one of the other alternatives, the court must require that the information or evidence obtained by alternative means and provided by a professional or nonparty:  (A) Be in writing and fully document the child\u2019s views on the matters on which the child wished to express an opinion;  (B) Describe the child\u2019s input in sufficient detail to assist the court in its adjudication process;  127  (C) Be provided to the court and to the parties by an individual who will be available for testimony and cross-examination; and  (D) Be filed in the confidential portion of the family law file.   (3) On deciding to take the testimony of a child, the judicial officer should balance the necessity of taking the child\u2019s testimony in the courtroom with parents and attorneys present with the need to create an environment in which the child can be open and honest. In each case in which a child\u2019s testimony will be taken, courts should consider:  (A) Where the testimony will be taken, including the possibility of closing the courtroom to the public or hearing from the child on the record in chambers;  (B) Who should be present when the testimony is taken, such as: both parents and their attorneys, only attorneys in the case in which both parents are represented, the child\u2019s attorney and parents, or only a court reporter with the judicial officer;  (C) How the child will be questioned, such as whether only the judicial officer will pose questions that the parties have submitted, whether attorneys or parties will be permitted to cross-examine the child, or whether a child advocate or expert in child development will ask the questions in the presence of the judicial officer and parties or a court reporter; and  (D) Whether a court reporter is available in all instances, but especially when testimony may be taken outside the presence of the parties and their attorneys and, if not, whether it will be possible to provide a listening device so that testimony taken in chambers may be heard simultaneously by the parents and their attorneys in the courtroom or to otherwise make a record of the testimony.  (4) In taking testimony from a child, the court must take special care to protect \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": "repetition of questions. The court must also take special care to ensure that questions are stated in a form that is appropriate to the witness\u2019s age or cognitive level. If the child is not represented by an attorney, the court must  inform the child in an age-appropriate manner about the limitations on confidentiality and that the information provided to the court will be on the record and provided to the parties in the case. In the process of listening to  128 and inviting the child\u2019s input, the court must allow but not require the child to state a preference regarding custody or visitation and should, in an age-appropriate manner, provide information about the process by which the court will make a decision.  (5) In any case in which a child will be called to testify, the court may consider the appointment of minor\u2019s counsel for that child. The court may consider whether such appointment will cause unnecessary delay or otherwise interfere with the child\u2019s ability to participate in the process. In addition to adhering to the requirements for minor\u2019s counsel under Family Code section 3151 and rules 5.240, 5.241, and 5.242, and subdivision (c) of this rule, minor\u2019s counsel must:  (A) Provide information to the child in an age-appropriate manner about the limitations on confidentiality and indicate to the child the possibility that information provided to the court will be on the record and provided to the parties in the case;  (B) Allow but not require the child to state a preference regarding custody or visitation (parenting time) and, in an age-appropriate manner, provide information about the process by which the court will make a decision;  (C) Provide procedures relevant to the child\u2019s participation and, if appropriate, provide an orientation to the courtroom where the child will be testifying; and  (6) No testimony of a child may be received without such testimony being heard on the record or in the presence of the parties.  This requirement may not be waived by stipulation.  (Subd (e) relettered and amended effective January 1, 2023; adopted as subd (d).)  (f) Additional responsibilities of court-connected or appointed professionals  In addition to the duties in (c), a child custody evaluator, a child custody recommending counselor, or an investigator assigned to meet with a child in a family court proceeding must:  (1) Provide information to the child in an age-appropriate manner about the limitations on confidentiality and the possibility that information provided to the professional may be shared with the court on the record and provided to the parties in the case;  129  (2) Allow but not require the child to state a preference regarding custody and visitation (parenting time), and, in an age-appropriate manner, provide information about the process by which the court will make a decision; and  (3) Provide to the parents of the child participating in the court process information about local court procedures relevant to the child\u2019s participation and information about how to best support the child in an age-appropriate manner during the court process.  (Subd (f) relettered and amended effective January 1, 2023; adopted as subd (e).)   (g) Methods of providing information to parents and supporting children  Courts should provide information to parties and parents and support for children when children want to participate or testify or are otherwise involved in family law proceedings. Such methods may include but are not limited to:  (1) Having court-connected professionals meet jointly or separately with the parents or parties to discuss alternatives to having a child provide direct testimony;  (2) Providing an orientation for a child about the court process and the role of the judicial officer in making decisions, how the courtroom or chambers will be set up, and what participating or testifying will entail;  (3) Providing information to parents or parties before and after a child participates or testifies so that they can consider the possible effect on their child of participating or not participating in a given case;  (4) Including information in child custody mediation orientation presentations and publications about a child\u2019s participation in family law proceedings;  (5) Providing a children\u2019s waiting room; and  (6) Providing an interpreter for the child, if needed.  (Subd (g) relettered effective January 1, 2023; adopted as subd (f).)   130 (h) Education and training  Education and training content for court staff and judicial officers should include information on children\u2019s participation in family court processes, methods other than direct testimony for receiving input from children, and procedures for taking children\u2019s testimony.  (Subd (h) relettered effective January 1, 2023; adopted as subd (g).)  Rule 5.250 amended effective January 1, 202; adopted effective January 1, 2012.  Advisory Committee Comment  Rule 5.250 does not apply to probate guardianships except as and to the extent that the rule is incorporated or expressly made applicable by a rule of court in title 7 of the California Rules of Court.

(1) A party requesting support orders must include a current, completed Income and Expense Declaration  (form FL-150) with the Request for Order  (form FL-300) that is filed with the court and served on all parties.  (2) A party responding to a request for support orders must include a current, completed Income and Expense Declaration (form FL-150) with the   131 Responsive Declaration to Request for Order  (form FL-320) that is filed with the court and served on all parties.  (3) \u201cCurrent\u201d means the form has been completed within the past three months providing no facts have changed. The form must be sufficiently completed to allow the court to make an order.  (4) In child support hearings, a party may complete a current  Financial Statement (Simplified) (form FL-155) instead of a current Income and Expense Declaration (form FL-150) if he or she meets the requirements allowing submission of a Financial Statement (Simplified)  (form FL-155).  (5) Financial Statement (Simplified)  (form FL-155) is not appropriate for use in proceedings to determine or modify spousal or domestic partner support, to determine or modify family support, or to determine attorney\u2019s fees and costs.  (b) Deviations from guideline child support in orders and judgments  (1) If a party contends that the amount of support as calculated under the statewide uniform guideline formula is inappropriate, that party must file a declaration stating the amount of support alleged to be proper and the factual and legal bases justifying a deviation from guideline support under Family Code section 4057.  (2) In its discretion, for good cause shown, the court may deviate from the amount of guideline support resulting from the computer calculation. If the  court finds good cause to deviate from the statewide uniform guideline formula for child support, the court must state its findings in writing or on the record as required by Family Code sections 4056, 4057, and 4065.  (3) Stipulated agreements for child support that deviate from the statewide uniform guideline must include either a Non-Guideline Child Support Findings Attachment  (form FL-342(A)) or language in the agreement or judgment conforming with Family Code sections 4056 and 4065.  (c) Request to change prior support orders  The supporting declaration submitted in a request to change a prior child, spousal, or domestic partner support order must include specific facts demonstrating a change of circumstances. No change of circumstances must be shown to change a previously agreed upon child support order that was below the child support guidelines.  132  (d) Notification to the local child support agency  The party requesting court orders must provide the local child support agency timely notice of any request to establish, change, or enforce any child, spousal, or domestic partner support order if the agency is providing support enforcement services or has intervened in the case as described in Family Code section 17400.  (e) Judgment for support  (1) If child support is an issue in a judgment:  (A) Each party should file a proposed support calculation with the proposed judgment that sets forth the party\u2019s assumptions with regard to gross income, tax filing status, time-share, add-on expenses, and any other factor relevant to the support calculation.  (B) The moving party should file the documents in (A) with the proposed judgment if the judgment is based on respondent\u2019s default or a stipulation of the parties.  (C) The court may use and must permit parties or their attorneys to use any software certified by the Judicial Council to present support calculations to the court.  (2) If spousal or domestic partner support is an issue in a judgment:  (A) Use of support calculation software is not appropriate when requesting a judgment or modification of a judgment for spousal or domestic partner support.  (B) Petitioner or the parties may use Spousal or Partnership Support Declaration Attachment  (form FL-157) to address the issue of spousal or domestic partner support under Family Code section 4320 when relevant to the case.

(2) Using examples provided by the Judicial Council, the software must calculate a child support amount, using its default settings, that is accurate to within 1 percent of the correct amount. In making this determination, the Judicial Council must calculate the correct amount of support for each example and  134 must then calculate the amount for each example using the software program. Each person seeking certification of software must supply a copy of the software to the Judicial Council. If the software does not operate on a standard Windows 95 or later compatible or Macintosh computer, the person seeking certification of the software must make available to the Judicial Council any hardware required to use the software. The Judicial Council may delegate the responsibility for the calculation and determinations required by this rule.  (3) The software must contain, either on the screen or in written form, a glossary defining each term used on the computer screen or in printed hard copy produced by the software.

Transfer of title IV-D cases between tribal court and state court  (a) Purpose  This rule is intended to define the procedure for transfer of title IV-D child support cases between a California superior court and a tribal court.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2018.)  (b) Definitions  (1) \u201cTribal court\u201d means any tribal court of a federally recognized Indian tribe located in California that is receiving funding from the federal government to operate a child support program under title IV-D of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 654 et seq.).  (2) \u201cSuperior court\u201d means a superior court of the state of California.  156  (3) \u201cTitle IV-D child support cases\u201d include all cases where title IV-D services are being provided whether the case originates from the local child support agency\u2019s filing of a summons and complaint or later becomes a title IV-D case when the local child support agency registers a child support order or intervenes in a child support action by filing a change of payee.  (c) Disclosure of related case  A party must disclose in superior court whether there is any related action in tribal court in the first pleading, in an attached affidavit, or under oath. A party\u2019s disclosure of a related action must include the names and addresses of the parties to the action, the name and address of the tribal court where the action is filed, the case number of the action, and the name of judge assigned to the action, if known.  (d) Notice of intent to transfer case  Before filing a motion for case transfer of a child support matter from a superior court to a tribal court, the party requesting the transfer, the state title IV-D agency, or the tribal IV-D agency must provide the parties with notice of their right to object to the case transfer and the procedures to make such an objection.  (e) Determination of concurrent jurisdiction by a superior court  (1) The superior court may, on its own motion or on the motion of any party and after notice to the parties of their right to object, transfer a child support and custody provision of an action in which the state is providing services under Family Code section 17400 to a tribal court, as defined in (a). This provision applies to both prejudgment and postjudgment cases.  (2) The motion for transfer to a tribal court must include the following information:  (A) Whether the child is a tribal member or eligible for tribal membership;  (B) Whether one or both of the child\u2019s parents are tribal members or eligible for tribal membership;  \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": "tribal housing, work for the tribe, or receive tribal benefits or services;  (D) Whether there are other children of the obligor subject to child support obligations;  157  (E) Any other factor supporting the child\u2019s or parents\u2019 connection to the tribe.  (3) When ruling on a motion to transfer, the superior court must first make a threshold determination that concurrent jurisdiction exists. Evidence to support this determination may include:  (A) Evidence contained within the motion for transfer;  (B) Evidence agreed to by stipulation of the parties; and  (C) Other evidence submitted by the parties or by the tribe.   The court may request that the tribal child support agency or the tribal court submit information concerning the tribe\u2019s jurisdiction.  (4) There is a presumption of concurrent jurisdiction if the child is a tribal member or eligible for tribal membership. If concurrent jurisdiction is found to exist, the transfer to tribal court will occur unless a party has objected within 20 days after service of notice of the right to object referenced in subdivision (e)(1) above. On the filing of a timely objection to the transfer, the superior court must conduct a hearing on the record considering all the relevant factors set forth in (f). The objecting party has the burden of proof to establish good cause not to transfer to tribal court.  (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2018.)  (f) Evidentiary considerations  (1) In making a determination on the motion for case transfer, the superior court must consider:  (A) The identities of the parties;  (B) The convenience of the parties and witnesses;  (C) The remedy available in the superior court or tribal court; and  (D) Any other factors deemed necessary by the superior court.  (2) In making a determination on the motion for case transfer, the superior court may not consider the perceived adequacy of tribal justice systems.  158  (3) The superior court may, after notice to all parties, attempt to resolve any procedural issues by contacting the tribal court concerning a motion to transfer. The superior court must allow the parties to participate in, and must prepare a record of, any communication made with the tribal court judge.  (Subd (f) amended effective January 1, 2018.)  (g) Order on request to transfer  If the superior court denies the request for transfer, the court must state on the record the basis for denying the request. If the superior court grants the request for transfer, it must issue a final order on the request to transfer including a determination of whether concurrent jurisdiction exists.  (Subd (g) amended effective January 1, 2018.)  (h) Proceedings after order granting transfer  Once the superior court has granted the application to transfer and has received confirmation that the tribal court has accepted jurisdiction, the superior court clerk must deliver a copy of the entire file, including all pleadings and orders, to the clerk of the tribal court within 20 days of confirmation that the tribal court has accepted jurisdiction. With the exception of a filing by a tribal court as described by subdivision (i) of this rule, the superior court may not accept any further filings in the state court action in relation to the issues of child support and custody that were transferred to the tribal court.  (Subd (h) amended effective January 1, 2018.)  (i) Transfer of proceedings from tribal court  (1) If a tribal court determines that it is not in the best interest of the child or the parties for the tribal court to retain jurisdiction of a child support case, the tribe may, upon noticed motion to all parties and the state child support agency, file a motion with the superior court to transfer the case to the jurisdiction of the superior court along with copies of the tribal court\u2019s order transferring jurisdiction and the entire file.  (2) The superior court must notify the tribal court upon receipt of the materials and the date scheduled for the hearing of the motion to transfer.  (3) If the superior court has concurrent jurisdiction, it must not reject the case.  159  (4) No filing fee may be charged for the transfer of a title IV-D child support case from a tribal court.  (Subd (i) adopted effective January 1, 2018.)  Rule 5.372 amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted effective January 1, 2014.  Advisory Committee Comment  This rule applies only to title IV-D child support cases. In the normal course, transfers from tribal court are initiated by the local child support agencies. Under Government Code sections 6103.9 and 70672, local child support agencies are exempt from payment of filing fees. The rule makes it clear that this exemption also applies when an eligible case is being transferred from a tribal court.  Rule 5.375.  Procedure for a support obligor to file a motion regarding mistaken identity  (a) Purpose  This rule applies to a support obligor who claims that support enforcement actions have erroneously been taken against him or her by the local child support agency because of a mistake in the support obligor\u2019s identity. This rule sets forth the procedure for filing a motion in superior court to establish the mistaken identity under Family Code section 17530 after the support obligor has filed a claim of mistaken identity with the local child support agency and the claim has been denied.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2003.)  (b) Procedure for filing motion in superior court  The support obligor\u2019s motion in superior court to establish mistaken identity must be filed on  Request for Order (form FL-300) with appropriate attachments. The support obligor must also file as exhibits to the request for order a copy of the claim of mistaken identity that he or she filed with the local child support agency and a copy of the local child support agency\u2019s denial of the claim.

Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivisions (a), (b), (d), and (e). The process described in this rule need not be used if the request for confidentiality is merely to keep an address confidential and the minor has a mailing address which does not need to be kept private that can be listed on the forms, or if the minor\u2019s address can be made confidential under Family Code section 3429. In addition, the address need not be listed on the protective order for enforcement purposes under Family Code section 6225. The restraining order forms do not require the address of the nonpetitioning minor.  This rule and rule 2.551 provide a standard and procedures for courts to follow when a request is made to seal a record. The standard as reflected in Family Code section 6301.5 is based on NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178. The standard recognizes the First Amendment right of access to documents used at trial or as a basis of adjudication.   Article 2.

A party requesting a separate trial or responding to a request for a separate trial must complete Application or Response to Application for Separate Trial  (form FL-315).   173 (b) When to bifurcate  The court may separately try one or more issues before trial of the other issues if resolution of the bifurcated issue is likely to simplify the determination of the other issues. Issues that may be appropriate to try separately in advance include:  (1) Validity of a postnuptial or premarital agreement;  (2) Date of separation;  (3) Date to use for valuation of assets;  (4) Whether property is separate or community;  (5) How to apportion increase in value of a business;  (6) Existence or value of business or professional goodwill;  (7) Termination of status of a marriage or domestic partnership;  (8) Child custody and visitation (parenting time);  (9) Child, spousal, or domestic partner support;  (10) Attorney\u2019s fees and costs;  (11) Division of property and debts;  (12) Reimbursement claims; or  (13) Other issues specific to a family law case.  (c) Alternate date of valuation  Requests for separate trial regarding alternate date of valuation under Family Code section 2552(b) must be accompanied by a declaration stating the following:  (1) The proposed alternate valuation date;  (2)  Whether the proposed alternate valuation date applies to all or only a portion of the assets and, if the Request for Order  (FL-300) is directed to only a portion of the assets, the declaration must separately identify each such asset; and  174  (3)  The reasons supporting the alternate valuation date.  (d) Separate trial to terminate status of marriage or domestic partnership  (1) All pension plans that have not been divided by court order that require joinder must be joined as a party to the case before a petitioner or respondent may file a request for a separate trial to terminate marital status or the domestic partnership. Parties may refer to Retirement Plan Joinder\u2014Information Sheet  (form FL-318-INFO) to help determine whether their retirement benefit plans must be joined.  (2) The party not requesting termination of status may ask the court:  (A) To order that the judgment granting a dissolution include conditions that preserve his or her claims in retirement benefit plans, health insurance, and other assets; and  (B) For other orders made as conditions to terminating the parties\u2019 marital status or domestic partnership.  (3) The court must use Bifurcation of Status of Marriage or Domestic Partnership\u2014Attachment  (form FL-347) as an attachment to the order after hearing in these matters.  (4) In cases involving division of pension benefits acquired by the parties during the marriage or domestic partnership, the court must use Pension Benefits\u2014Attachment to Judgment  (form FL-348) to set out the orders upon severance of the status of marriage or domestic partnership. The form serves as a temporary qualified domestic relations order and must be attached to the status-only judgment and then served on the plan administrator. It can also be attached to a judgment to allow the parties time to prepare a qualified domestic relations order.  (e) Notice by clerk  Within 10 days after the order deciding the bifurcated issue and any statement of decision under rule 3.1591 have been filed, the clerk must serve copies to the parties and file a certificate of mailing or a certificate of electronic service.

{"prompt": "215  Rule 5.480.  Application  This chapter addressing the Indian Child Welfare Act (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901 et seq.) as codified in various sections of the Family Code, Probate Code, and Welfare and Institutions Codes, applies to most proceedings involving Indian children that may result in an involuntary foster care placement; guardianship or conservatorship placement; custody placement under Family Code section 3041; declaration freeing a child from the custody and control of one or both parents; termination of parental rights; preadoptive placement; or adoptive placement. This chapter applies to:  (1) Proceedings under Welfare and Institutions Code section 300 et seq.;  (2) Proceedings under Welfare and Institutions Code sections 601 and 602 et seq., whenever the child is either in foster care or at risk of entering foster care. In these proceedings, inquiry is required in accordance with rule 5.481(a). The other requirements of this chapter contained in rules 5.481 through 5.487 apply only if:  (A) The court\u2019s jurisdiction is based on conduct that would not be criminal if the child were 18 years of age or over;  (B) The court has found that placement outside the home of the parent or legal guardian is based entirely on harmful conditions within the child\u2019s home. Without a specific finding, it is presumed that placement outside the home is based at least in part on the child\u2019s criminal conduct, and this chapter shall not apply; or  (C) The court is setting a hearing to terminate parental rights of the child\u2019s parents.  (3) Proceedings under Family Code section 3041;  (4) Proceedings under the Family Code resulting in adoption or termination of parental rights; and  (5) Proceedings listed in Probate Code section 1459.5 and rule 7.1015.  This chapter does not apply to voluntary foster care and guardianship placements where the child can be returned to the parent or Indian custodian on demand.

(1) The party seeking a foster-care placement, guardianship, conservatorship, custody placement under Family Code section 3041, declaration freeing a child from the custody or control of one or both parents, termination of parental rights, preadoptive placement, or adoption must ask the child, if the child is old enough, and the parents, Indian custodian, or legal guardians, extended family members, others who have an interest in the child, and where applicable the party reporting child abuse or neglect, whether the child is or may be an Indian child and whether the residence or domicile of the child, the parents, or Indian custodian is on a reservation or in an Alaska Native village, and must complete the Indian Child Inquiry Attachment  (form ICWA-010(A)) and attach it to the petition unless the party is filing a subsequent petition, and there is no new information.  (2) At the first appearance by a parent, Indian custodian, or guardian, and all other participants in any dependency case; or in juvenile wardship proceedings in which the child is at risk of entering foster care or is in foster care; or at the initiation of any guardianship, conservatorship, proceeding for custody under Family Code section 3041, proceeding to terminate parental rights, proceeding to declare a child free of the custody and control of one or both parents, preadoptive placement, or adoption proceeding; and at each hearing that may culminate in an order for foster care placement, termination of parental rights, preadoptive placement or adoptive placement, as described in Welfare and Institutions Code section 224.1(d)(1), or that may result in an order for guardianship, conservatorship, or custody under Family Code section 3041; the court must:  (A) Ask each participant present whether the participant knows or has reason to know the child is an Indian child;  217  (B) Instruct the parties to inform the court if they subsequently receive information that provides reason to know the child is an Indian child; and  (C) Order the parent, Indian custodian, or guardian, if available, to complete Parental Notification of Indian Status (form ICWA-020).  (3) If the parent, Indian custodian, or guardian does not appear at the first hearing, or is unavailable at the initiation of a proceeding, the court must order the person or entity that has the inquiry duty under this rule to use reasonable diligence to find and inform the parent, Indian custodian, or guardian that the court has ordered the parent, Indian custodian, or guardian to complete Parental Notification of Indian Status (form ICWA-020).  (4) If the social worker, probation officer, licensed adoption agency, adoption service provider, investigator, or petitioner knows or has reason to know or believe that an Indian child is or may be involved, that person or entity must make further inquiry as soon as practicable by:  (A) Interviewing the parents, Indian custodian, and \u201cextended family members\u201d as defined in 25 United States Code section 1903, to gather the information listed in Welfare and Institutions Code section 224.3(a)(5), Family Code section 180(b)(5), or Probate Code section 1460.2(b)(5);  (B) Contacting the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the California Department of Social Services for assistance in identifying the names and contact information of the tribes in which the child may be a member or eligible for membership; and  (C) Contacting the tribes and any other person who reasonably can be expected to have information regarding the child\u2019s membership status or eligibility. These contacts must at a minimum include the contacts and sharing of information listed in Welfare and Institutions Code section 224.2(e)(3).  (5) The petitioner must on an ongoing basis include in its filings a detailed description of all inquiries, and further inquiries it has undertaken, and all information received pertaining to the child\u2019s Indian status, as well as evidence of how and when this information was provided to the relevant tribes. Whenever new information is received, that information must be expeditiously provided to the tribes.  218  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2020; previously amended effective January 1, 2013.)  (b) Reason to know the child is an Indian child  (1) There is reason to know a child involved in a proceeding is an Indian child if:  (A) A person having an interest in the child, including the child, an officer of the court, a tribe, an Indian organization, a public or private agency, or a member of the child\u2019s extended family informs the court the child is an Indian child;  (B) The residence or domicile of the child, the child\u2019s parents, or Indian custodian is on a reservation or in an Alaska Native village;  (C) Any participant in the proceeding, officer of the court, Indian tribe, Indian organization, or agency informs the court that it has discovered information indicating that the child is an Indian child;  (D) The child who is the subject of the proceeding gives the court reason to know he or she is an Indian child;  (E) The court is informed that the child is or has been a ward of a tribal court; or  (F) The court is informed that either parent or the child possesses an identification card indicating membership or citizenship in an Indian tribe.  (2) When there is reason to know the child is an Indian child, but the court does not have sufficient evidence to determine that the child is or is not an Indian child, the court must confirm, by way of a report, declaration, or testimony included in the record that the agency or other party used due diligence to identify and work with all of the tribes of which there is reason to know the child may be a member, or eligible for membership, to verify whether the child is in fact a member or whether a biological parent is a member and the child is eligible for membership. Due diligence must include the further inquiry and tribal contacts discussed in (a)(4) above.  (3) Upon review of the evidence of due diligence, further inquiry, and tribal contacts, if the court concludes that the agency or other party has fulfilled its duty of due diligence, further inquiry, and tribal contacts, the court may:  219  (A) Find there is no reason to know the child is an Indian child and the Indian Child Welfare Act does not apply. Notwithstanding this determination, if the court or a party subsequently receives information that was not previously available relevant to the child\u2019s Indian status, the court must reconsider this finding; or  (B) Find it is known the child is an Indian child, and that the Indian Child Welfare Act applies, and order compliance with the requirements of the act, including notice in accordance with (c) below; or  (C) Find there is reason to know the child is an Indian child, order notice in accordance with (c) below, and treat the child as an Indian child unless and until the court determines on the record that the child is not an Indian child.  (4) A determination by an Indian tribe that a child is or is not a member of, or eligible for membership in, that tribe, or testimony attesting to that status by a person authorized by the tribe to provide that determination, must be conclusive. Information that the child is not enrolled, or is not eligible for enrollment in, the tribe is not determinative of the child\u2019s membership status unless the tribe also confirms in writing that enrollment is a prerequisite for membership under tribal law or custom.  (Subd (b) adopted effective January 1, 2020.)   (c) Notice  (1) If it is known or there is reason to know an Indian child is involved in a proceeding listed in rule 5.480, except for a wardship proceeding under Welfare and Institutions Code sections 601 and 602 et seq., the social worker, petitioner, or in probate guardianship and conservatorship proceedings, if the petitioner is unrepresented, the court, must send Notice of Child Custody Proceeding for Indian Child (form ICWA-030) to the parent or legal guardian and Indian custodian of an Indian child, and the Indian child\u2019s tribe, in the manner specified in Welfare and Institutions Code section 224.3, Family Code section 180, and Probate Code section 1460.2 for all initial hearings that may result in the foster care placement, termination of parental rights, preadoptive placement, or adoptive placement, or an order of guardianship, conservatorship, or custody under Family Code section 3041.

(2) When the court receives confirmation that the child is already a ward of a tribal court or is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of an Indian tribe, the state court must dismiss the proceeding and ensure that the tribal court is sent all information regarding the proceeding, including, but not limited to, the pleadings and any state court record. If the local agency has not already transferred physical custody of the Indian child to the child\u2019s tribe, the state court must order that the local agency do so forthwith and hold in abeyance any dismissal order pending confirmation that the Indian child is in the physical custody of the tribe.  (3) This section does not preclude an emergency removal consistent with 25 United States Code section 1922, 25 Code of Federal Regulations part 23.113, and Welfare and Institutions Code section 319 to protect the child from risk of imminent physical damage or harm and if more time is needed to facilitate the transfer of custody of the Indian child from the county welfare department to the tribe.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2020.)   (b) Presumptive transfer of case to tribal court with concurrent state and tribal jurisdiction  Unless the court finds good cause under subdivision (d), the court must order transfer of a case to the tribal court of the child\u2019s tribe if the parent, the Indian custodian, or the child\u2019s tribe requests.  (c) Documentation of request to transfer a case to tribal court  (1) The parent, the Indian custodian, or the child\u2019s tribe may request transfer of the case, either orally or in writing or by filing Notice of Petition and Petition to Transfer Case Involving an Indian Child to Tribal Jurisdiction  (form ICWA-050).   If the request is made orally, the court must document the request and make it part of the record.   225 (2) Upon receipt of a transfer petition, the state court must ensure that the tribal court is promptly notified in writing of the transfer petition. This notification may request a timely response regarding whether the tribal court wishes to decline the transfer.  (Subd (C) amended effective January 1, 2020.)  (d) Cause to deny a request to transfer to tribal court with concurrent state and tribal jurisdiction  (1) Either of the following circumstances constitutes mandatory good cause to deny a request to transfer:  (A) One or both of the child\u2019s parents objects to the transfer in open court or in an admissible writing for the record; or  (B) The tribal court of the child\u2019s tribe declines the transfer.  (2) In assessing whether good cause to deny the transfer exists, the court must not consider: \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": "(A) Socioeconomic conditions and the perceived adequacy of tribal social services or judicial systems;  (B) Whether the child custody proceeding is at an advanced stage if the Indian child\u2019s parent, Indian custodian, or tribe did not receive notice of the child custody proceeding until an advanced stage. It must not, in and of itself, be considered an unreasonable delay for a party to wait until reunification efforts have failed and reunification services have been terminated before filing a petition to transfer;  (C) Whether there have been prior proceedings involving the child for which no transfer petition was filed;  (D) Whether transfer could affect the placement of the child; or  (E) Whether the Indian child has cultural connections with the tribe or its reservation.  (3) If it appears that there is good cause to deny a transfer, the court must hold an evidentiary hearing on the transfer and make its findings on the record.   226 (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2020; previously amended effective January 1, 2013.)  (e) Evidentiary burdens  (1) The burden of establishing good cause to deny a request to transfer is on the party opposing the transfer.  (2) If the court believes, or any party asserts, that good cause to deny the request exists, the reasons for that belief or assertion must be stated orally on the record or in writing, in advance of the hearing, and made available to all parties who are requesting the transfer, and the petitioner must have the opportunity to provide information or evidence in rebuttal of the belief or assertion.  (Subd (e) relettered effective January 1, 2020; adopted as subd (f); previously amended effective January 1, 2013.)  (f) Order on request to transfer  (1) The court must issue its final order on the Order on Petition to Transfer Case Involving an Indian Child to Tribal Jurisdiction  (form ICWA-060).  (2) When a matter is being transferred from the jurisdiction of a juvenile court, the order must include:  (A) All of the findings, orders, or modifications of orders that have been made in the case;  (B) The name and address of the tribe to which jurisdiction is being transferred;  (C) Directions for the agency to release the child case file to the tribe having jurisdiction under section 827.15 of the Welfare and Institutions Code;  (D) Directions that all papers contained in the child case file must be transferred to the tribal court; and  (E) Directions that a copy of the transfer order and the findings of fact must be maintained by the transferring court.   227 (Subd (f) relettered effective January 1, 2020; adopted as subd (g); previously amended effective January 1, 2016.)  (g) Advisement when transfer order granted  When the court grants a petition transferring a case to tribal court under Welfare and Institutions Code section 305.5, Family Code section 177(a), or Probate Code section 1459.5(b) and rule 5.483, the court must advise the parties orally and in writing that any appeal to the order for transfer to a tribal court must be made before the transfer to tribal jurisdiction is finalized and that failure to request and obtain a stay of the order for transfer will result in a loss of appellate jurisdiction.  (Subd (g) relettered effective January 1, 2020; adopted as subd (h); previously amended effective January 1, 2016.)  (h) Proceeding after transfer  When, under Welfare and Institutions Code section 305.5, Family Code section 177(a), or Probate Code section 1459.5(b), the court transfers any proceeding listed in rule 5.480, the court must proceed as follows:  (1) Dismiss the proceeding or terminate jurisdiction if the court has received proof that the tribal court has accepted the transfer of jurisdiction;  (2) Make an order transferring the physical custody of the child to a designated representative of the tribal court (not necessarily the same \u201cdesignated representative\u201d identified in the Notice of Designation of Tribal Representative and Notice of Intervention in a Court Proceeding Involving an Indian Child (form ICWA-040)); and  (3) Include in the Order on Petition to Transfer Case Involving an Indian Child to Tribal Jurisdiction  (form ICWA-060) all contact information for the designated tribal court representative.

Advisory Committee Comment   228 Once a transfer to tribal court is finalized as provided in rule 5.483(h), the appellate court lacks jurisdiction to order the case returned to state court ( In re M.M. (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 897).  As stated by the Court of Appeal in In re M.M ., the juvenile court has the discretion to stay the provisions of a judgment or order awarding, changing, or affecting custody of a minor child \u201cpending review on appeal or for any other period or periods that it may deem appropriate\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 917.7), and the party seeking review of the transfer order should first request a stay in the lower court. (See Nuckolls v. Bank of California, Nat. Assn. (1936) 7 Cal.2d 574, 577 [61 P.2d 927] [\u201cInasmuch as the [L]egislature has provided a method by which the trial court, in a proper case, may grant the stay, the appellate courts, assuming that they have the power, should not, except in some unusual emergency, exercise their power until the petitioner has first presented the matter to the trial court.\u201d].) If the juvenile court should deny the stay request, the aggrieved party may then petition this court for a writ of supersedeas pending appeal. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.112).  Subdivision (g) and this advisory committee comment are added to help ensure that an objecting party does not inadvertently lose the right to appeal a transfer order.  Former rule 5.484.  Renumbered effective January 1, 2020 Rule 5.484 renumbered as rule 5.485  Rule 5.484.  Emergency proceedings involving an Indian child  (a) Standards for removal  Whenever it is known or there is reason to know the case involves an Indian child, the court may not order an emergency removal or placement of the child without a finding that the removal or placement is necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child. The petition requesting emergency removal or continued emergency placement of the child or its accompanying documents must contain the following:  (1) A statement of the risk of imminent physical damage or harm to the child and any evidence that the emergency removal or placement continues to be necessary to prevent such imminent physical damage or harm to the child;  (2) The name, age, and last known address of the Indian child;  (3) The name and address of the child\u2019s parents and Indian custodian, if any;  (4) The steps taken to provide notice to the child\u2019s parents, Indian custodian, and tribe about the emergency proceeding;   229 (5) If the child\u2019s parents and Indian custodian are unknown, a detailed explanation of what efforts have been made to locate and contact them;  (6) The residence and the domicile of the Indian child;  (7) If either the residence or the domicile of the Indian child is believed to be on a reservation or in an Alaska Native village, the name of the tribe affiliated with that reservation or village;  (8) The tribal affiliation of the child and of the parents or Indian custodian;  (9) A specific and detailed account of the circumstances that led to the emergency removal of the child;  (10) If the child is believed to reside or be domiciled on a reservation where the tribe exercises exclusive jurisdiction over child custody matters, a statement of efforts that have been made and are being made to contact the tribe and transfer the child to the tribe\u2019s jurisdiction; and  (11) A statement of the efforts that have been taken to assist the parents or Indian custodian so the Indian child may safely be returned to their custody.  (b) Return of Indian child when emergency situation has ended  (1) Whenever it is known or there is reason to know the child is an Indian child and there has been an emergency removal of the child from parental custody, any party who asserts that there is new information indicating that the emergency situation has ended may request an ex parte hearing by filing a request on Request for Ex Parte Hearing to Return Physical Custody of an Indian Child (form ICWA-070) to determine whether the emergency situation has ended.  (2) If the request provides evidence of new information establishing that the emergency placement is no longer necessary, the court must promptly schedule a hearing. At the hearing the court must consider whether the child\u2019s removal and placement is still necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child. If the court determines that the child\u2019s emergency removal or placement is no longer necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child, the court must order the child returned to the physical custody of the parents or Indian custodian.   230 (3) In accordance with rules 3.10 and 3.20, this procedure is governed by the provisions of division 6, chapter 3 and division 11, chapter 4 of title 3 of the California Rules of Court.  (c) Time limitation on emergency proceedings  An emergency removal must not continue for more than 30 days unless the court makes the following determinations:  (1) Restoring the child to the parent or Indian custodian would subject the child to imminent physical damage or harm;  (2) The court has been unable to transfer the proceeding to the jurisdiction of the appropriate Indian tribe; and  (3) It has not been possible to have a hearing that complies with the substantive requirements of the Indian Child Welfare Act for a foster care placement proceeding.

Placement of an Indian child  (a) Evidentiary burdens  In any child custody proceeding listed in rule 5.480, the court may not order placement of an Indian child unless it finds by clear and convincing evidence that continued custody with the parent or Indian custodian is likely to cause the Indian child serious emotional or physical damage and it considers evidence regarding prevailing social and cultural standards of the child\u2019s tribe, including that tribe\u2019s family organization and child-rearing practices.  (1) Testimony by a \u201cqualified expert witness,\u201d as defined in Welfare and Institutions Code section 224.6, Family Code section 177(a), and Probate Code section 1459.5(b), is required before a court orders a child placed in foster care or terminates parental rights.  (2) Stipulation by the parent, Indian custodian, or tribe, or failure to object, may waive the requirement of producing evidence of the likelihood of serious damage only if the court is satisfied that the person or tribe has been fully  \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": "knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived them. Any such stipulation must be agreed to in writing.  (3) Failure to meet non-Indian family and child-rearing community standards, or the existence of other behavior or conditions that meet the removal standards of Welfare and Institutions Code section 361, will not support an order for placement absent the finding that continued custody with the parent or Indian custodian is likely to cause serious emotional or physical damage.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2013.)  (b) Standards and preferences in placement of an Indian child  (1) All placements of an Indian child must be in the least restrictive setting that most approximates a family situation and in which the child\u2019s special needs, if any, may be met.  (2) Unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that there is good cause to deviate from them, whenever it is known or there is reason to know the child is an Indian child, all placement in any proceeding listed in rules 5.480 and 5.484 must follow the specified placement preferences in Family Code section 177(a), Probate Code section 1459(b), and Welfare and Institutions Code section 361.31.  (3) The court must analyze the availability of placements within the placement preferences in descending order without skipping. The court may deviate from the preference order only for good cause, which may include the following considerations:  (A) The requests of the parent or Indian custodian if they attest that they have reviewed the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of preference;  (B) The requests of the Indian child, when of sufficient age and capacity to understand the decision being made;  (C) The presence of a sibling attachment that can be maintained only through a particular placement;  (D) The extraordinary physical, mental, or emotional needs of the Indian child, including specialized treatment services that may be unavailable  232 in the community where families who meet the placement preferences live; or  (E) The unavailability of a suitable placement within the placement preferences based on a documented diligent effort to identify placements meeting the preference criteria. The standard for determining whether a placement is unavailable must conform to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the Indian child\u2019s parent or extended family resides or with which the Indian child\u2019s parent or extended family members maintain social and cultural ties.  (4) The placement preferences must be analyzed and considered each time there is a change in the child\u2019s placement. A finding that there is good cause to deviate from the placement preferences does not affect the requirement that a diligent search be made for a subsequent placement within the placement preferences.  (5) The burden of establishing good cause for the court to deviate from the preference order is on the party requesting that the preference order not be followed. A placement may not depart from the preferences based on the socioeconomic status of any placement relative to another or solely on the basis of ordinary bonding or attachment that flowed from time spent in a nonpreferred placement that was made in violation of the Indian Child Welfare Act.   (6) The tribe, by resolution, may establish a different preference order, which must be followed if it provides for the least restrictive setting.  (7) The preferences and wishes of the Indian child, when of sufficient age, and the parent must be considered, and weight given to a consenting parent\u2019s request for anonymity.  (8) When no preferred placement is available, active efforts must be made and documented to place the child with a family committed to enabling the child to have visitation with \u201cextended family members,\u201d as defined in rule 5.481(a)(4)(A), and participation in the cultural and ceremonial events of the child\u2019s tribe.  (Subd (b) amended  effective January 1, 2020; previously amended effective January 1, 2013.)   233 (c) Active efforts  In addition to any other required findings to place an Indian child with someone other than a parent or Indian custodian, or to terminate parental rights, the court must find that active efforts have been made, in any proceeding listed in rule 5.480, to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family, and must find that these efforts were unsuccessful. These active efforts must include affirmative, active, thorough, and timely efforts intended primarily to maintain or reunite the child with his or her family, must be tailored to the facts and circumstances of the case, and must be consistent with the requirements of Welfare and Institutions Code section 224.1(f).   (1) The active efforts must be documented in detail in the record.  (2) The court must consider whether active efforts were made in a manner consistent with the prevailing social and cultural conditions and way of life of the Indian child\u2019s tribe.  (3) Active efforts to provide services must include pursuit of any steps necessary to secure tribal membership for a child if the child is eligible for membership in a given tribe, as well as attempts to use the available resources of extended family members, the tribe, tribal and other Indian social service agencies, and individual Indian caregivers.

Termination of parental rights  (a) Evidentiary burdens  The court may only terminate parental rights to an Indian child or declare an Indian child free of the custody and control of one or both parents if at the hearing terminating parental rights or declaring the child free of the custody and control of one or both parents, the court:   234 (1) Finds by clear and convincing evidence that active efforts to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family were made; and  (2) Makes a determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of one or more \u201cqualified expert witnesses\u201d as defined in Welfare and Institutions Code section 224.6 and Family Code section 177(a), that the continued custody of the child by the parent is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.  (b) When parental rights may not be terminated  The court may not terminate parental rights to an Indian child or declare a child free from the custody and control of one or both parents if the court finds a compelling reason for determining that termination of parental rights would not be in the child\u2019s best interest. Such a reason may include:  (1) The child is living with a relative who is unable or unwilling to adopt the child because of circumstances that do not include an unwillingness to accept legal or financial responsibility for the child, but who is willing and capable of providing the child with a stable and permanent environment through legal guardianship, and the removal of the child from the custody of his or her relative would be detrimental to the emotional well-being of the child. For purposes of an Indian child, \u201crelative\u201d must include an \u201cextended family member,\u201d as defined in the Indian Child Welfare Act (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(2));  (2) Termination of parental rights would substantially interfere with the child\u2019s connection to his or her tribal community or the child\u2019s tribal membership rights; or  (3) The child\u2019s tribe has identified tribal customary adoption, guardianship, long-term foster care with a fit and willing relative, or another planned permanent living arrangement for the child.

Petition to invalidate orders  (a) Who may petition  Any Indian child who is the subject of any action for foster-care placement, guardianship or conservatorship placement, custody placement under Family Code section 3041, declaration freeing a child from the custody and control of one or both parents, preadoptive placement, adoptive placement, or termination of parental rights; any parent or Indian custodian from whose custody such child was removed; and the Indian child\u2019s tribe may petition the court to invalidate the action on a showing that the action violated the Indian Child Welfare Act.  (Subd (a) was amended effective January 1, 2020.)  (b) Court of competent jurisdiction  If the Indian child is a dependent child or ward of the juvenile court or the subject of a pending petition, the juvenile court is a court of competent jurisdiction with the authority to hear the request to invalidate the foster placement or termination of parental rights.  (c) Request to return custody of the Indian child  If a final decree of adoption is vacated or set aside, or if the adoptive parents voluntarily consent to the termination of their parental rights, a biological parent or prior Indian custodian may request a return of custody of the Indian child.  (1) The court must reinstate jurisdiction.  (2) In a juvenile case, the juvenile court must hold a new disposition hearing in accordance with 25 United States Code section 1901 et seq. where the court may consider all placement options as stated in Welfare and Institutions Code sections 361.31(b), (c), (d), and (h).  (3) The court may consider placement with a biological parent or prior Indian custodian if the biological parent or prior Indian custodian can show that placement with him or her is not detrimental to the child and that the placement is in the best interests of the child.  (4) The hearing on the request to return custody of an Indian child must be conducted in accordance with statutory requirements and the relevant sections of this rule.   236 Rule 5.487 renumbered and amended effective January 1, 2020; adopted as rule 5.486 effective January 1, 2008; previously amended effective January 1, 2013  Rule 5.488.

(d) Evidence required to verify compliance with the Hague Adoption Convention  If the Hague Adoption Convention applies to the case, and the court is asked to issue findings and an order supporting a request for the U.S. Department of State to issue a Hague Adoption Certificate or a Hague Custody Declaration for the adoption placement, the court must receive sufficient evidence to conclude that the child is eligible for adoption and find that the placement is in the best interest of the child. The court must receive evidence of all of the following:  (1) The adoption agency or provider is accredited by the Council on Accreditation, is supervised by an accredited primary provider, or is acting as an exempted provider, as defined in Family Code section 8900.5(g), to provide intercountry adoption services for convention cases;  (2) A child background study has been completed and transmitted to a foreign authorized entity in accordance with the regulations governing convention adoptions with proof that the necessary consents have been obtained and the reason for its determination that the proposed placement is in the child\u2019s best interest, based on the home study and child background study and giving due consideration to the child\u2019s upbringing and his or her ethnic, religious, and cultural background;  (3) The child is eligible for adoption under California law;  (4) The adoption agency or provider has made reasonable efforts, as described under 22 Code of Federal Regulations section 96.54(a), to place the child in the United States, but was unable to do so, or an exception to this requirement applies to the case.

Rule 5.490 adopted effective July 1, 2013.  Advisory Committee Comment  The Hague Adoption Convention (HAC) is a treaty that entered into force with respect to the United States on April 1, 2008. The HAC strengthens protections for children, birth parents, and prospective adoptive parents and establishes internationally agreed-upon rules and procedures for adoptions between countries that have a treaty relationship under the HAC. It provides a framework for countries party to the Convention to work together to ensure that children are provided with permanent, loving homes; that adoptions take place in the best interest of a child; and that the abduction, sale, or traffic of children is prevented. This rule expands procedurally on Family Code sections 8900 through 8925, which address intercountry adoptions, by specifying the findings and evidence set forth in 22 Code of Federal Regulations section 97.3 that are required by a state court when the HAC applies to an adoption.  Rule 5.491.  Adoption of a child resident in the United States by a resident of a foreign country not party to the Hague Adoption Convention  The adoption of a child resident in the United States by a resident of a foreign country not party to the Hague Adoption Convention must conform to the law governing California adoptions.  Rule 5.491 adopted effective July 1, 2013.  Rule 5.492.

Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16540\u201316545).  Consistent with section 16545, the Child Welfare Council and the secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency were consulted in adopting these performance measures. The appropriate court technology groups have also been consulted.  The Implementation Guide to Juvenile Dependency Court Performance Measures  is a companion publication to this rule, approved by the Judicial Council.   261 It is anticipated that the Judicial Council will update the  Implementation Guide  to Juvenile Dependency Court Performance Measures , as appropriate, to stay current with Court Case Management System (CCMS) requirements, local court needs, and the most recent versions of the relevant state and federal child welfare measures. Proposed updates other than those that are purely technical will be circulated for public comment prior to publication.   Chapter 2.  Commencement of Juvenile Court Proceedings  Rule 5.510.

This rule is intended to ensure fairness, accountability, and a high quality of service to children and families and to improve the safety, confidentiality, and consistency of dependency mediation programs statewide.  272  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Definitions  (1) \u201cDependency mediation\u201d is a confidential process conducted by specially trained, neutral third-party mediators who have no decision-making power. Dependency mediation provides a nonadversarial setting in which a mediator assists the parties in reaching a fully informed and mutually acceptable resolution that focuses on the child\u2019s safety and best interest and the safety of all family members. Dependency mediation is concerned with any and all issues related to child protection.  (2) \u201cSafety and best interest of the child\u201d refers to the child\u2019s physical, psychological, and emotional well-being. Determining the safety and best interest of the child includes consideration of all of the following:  (A) The preservation and strengthening of the family and family relationships whenever appropriate and possible;  (B) The manner in which the child may be protected from the risk of future abuse or neglect;  (C) The child\u2019s need for safety, stability, and permanency;  (D) The ongoing need of the child to cope with the issues that caused his or her involvement in the juvenile dependency system;  (E) The child\u2019s need for continuity of care and the effect that removal and subsequent placements have had, or may have, on the child; and  (F) The child\u2019s education, which includes the child\u2019s participation, progress, need for assistance, cognitive development and, if applicable, early childhood education and care, the need for special education and related services, and the extent to which the child has or has had limited English proficiency (LEP).  (3) \u201cSafety of family members\u201d refers to the physical, psychological, and emotional well-being of all family members, with consideration of the following:  (A) The role of domestic violence in creating a perceived or actual threat for the victim; and  273  (B) The ongoing need of family members to feel safe from physical, emotional, and psychological abuse.  (4) \u201cDifferential domestic violence assessment\u201d is a process used to assess the nature of any domestic violence issues in the family so that the mediator may conduct the mediation in such a way as to protect any victim of domestic violence from intimidation and to correct for power imbalances created by past violence and the fear of prospective violence.  (5) \u201cProtocols\u201d refer to any local set of rules, policies, and procedures developed and implemented by juvenile dependency mediation programs. All protocols must be developed in accordance with pertinent state laws, California Rules of Court, and local court rules.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2008; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)

When the participants speak different languages, interpreters, court-certified when possible, should be assigned to translate at the mediation session; and  (H) Dependency mediation services preserve, in accordance with pertinent law, party confidentiality, whether written or oral, by the:  (i) Storage and disposal of records and any personal information accumulated by the mediation program; and  (ii) Management of any new child abuse reports and related documents.  (2) Each dependency mediator must:  (A) Attempt to assist the mediation participants in reaching a settlement of the issues consistent with preserving the safety and best interest of the child, first and foremost, and the safety of all family members and participants;  (B) Discourage participants from blaming the victim and from denying or minimizing allegations of child abuse or violence against any family member;  (C) Be conscious of the values of preserving and strengthening the family as well as the child\u2019s need for permanency;  (D) Not make any recommendations or reports of any kind to the court, except for the terms of any agreement reached by the parties;  (E) Treat all mediation participants in a manner that preserves their dignity and self-respect;  (F) Promote a safe and balanced environment for all participants to express and advocate for their positions and interests;  275  (G) Identify and disclose potential grounds on which a mediator\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be challenged through a procedure that allows for the selection of another mediator within a reasonable time. If a dependency mediation program has only one mediator and the parties are unable to resolve the conflict, the mediator must inform the court;  (H) Identify and immediately disclose to the participants any reasonable concern regarding the mediator\u2019s continuing capacity to be impartial, so they can decide whether the mediator should withdraw or continue;  (I) Promote the participants\u2019 understanding of the status of the case in relation to the ongoing court process, what the case plan requires of them, and the terms of any agreement reached during the mediation; and  (J) Conduct an appropriate review to evaluate the viability of any agreement reached, including the identification of any provision that depends on the action or behavior of any individual who did not participate in creating the agreement.

Advisory Committee Comment  Because the intent of subdivision (j) is to expand access to the courts for caregivers of children in out-of-home care, the rule should be liberally construed. To promote caregiver participation and input, judicial officers are encouraged to permit caregivers to orally address the court when caregivers would like to share information about the child. In addition, court clerks should allow filings by caregivers even if the caregiver has not strictly adhered to the requirements in the rule regarding number of copies and filing deadlines.

The court must then proceed under Penal Code section 1324.  (1) After complying with an order to answer a question or produce evidence and if, but for those Penal Code sections or this rule, the witness would have been privileged to withhold the answer given or the evidence produced, no testimony or other information compelled under the order or information directly or indirectly derived from the testimony or other information may be used against the witness in any criminal case, including any juvenile court proceeding under section 602.

Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the child must remain in custody pending the continued hearing.  (2) At the initial detention hearing, if the court continues the hearing under (c)(1) or for any other reason, or sets the matter for rehearing, the court must either find that the continuance of the child in the parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s home is contrary to the child\u2019s welfare or order the child released to the custody of the parent or guardian. The court may enter this finding on a temporary basis, without prejudice to any party, and reevaluate the finding at the time of the continued detention hearing.

In considering whether a method is sound, the court must have information on:  (A) The names and qualifications of any nonprobation personnel who will have access to personally identifying information as defined in Civil Code section 1798.79.8(b);  (B) Procedures to mask personally identifying information that is shared electronically; and  (C) Data security protocols to ensure that access to the information is limited to those people authorized by the court.  (2) No further release, dissemination, or publication of personally identifying information by the probation department or a program evaluator, researcher, or research organization that is retained by the probation department will take place for research or evaluation purposes.  (3) The disclosure requirements of section 10850 are met if any dependency information in a delinquency file may be disclosed.  (4) A date for destruction of records containing personally identifying information in the possession of nonprobation department personnel has been set to prevent inappropriate disclosure of the records.   323 If the information is being released for human subject research as defined in 45 Code of Federal Regulations part 46, the probation department must provide notice to the office of the public defender 30 days before the court authorizes the release of the information so that the office has an opportunity to file an objection to the release with the court. If such an objection is filed within the 30 day period the court must set a hearing on the objection within 30 days of the filing of the objection to consider the objection and make a determination on whether and how release of information should be accomplished. Upon receiving authorization, but prior to the release of information, the probation department must enter into a formal agreement with the entity or entities conducting the research that specifies what may and may not be done with the information disclosed.

(e) Grounds for grant of petition (\u00a7\u00a7 388, 778)  (1) If the petition filed under section 388(a) or section 778(a) states a change of circumstance or new evidence and it appears that the best interest of the child, nonminor, or nonminor dependent may be promoted by the proposed change of order or termination of jurisdiction, the court may grant the petition after following the procedures in (f), (g), and (h), or (i).  (2) If the petition is filed under section 388(b) and it appears that the best interest of the child, nonminor, or nonminor dependent may be promoted by the proposed recognition of a sibling relationship or other requested orders, the court may grant the petition after following the procedures in (f), (g), and (h).  (3) If the petition is filed under section 388(b), the request is for visitation with a sibling who is not a dependent of the court and who is in the custody of a parent subject to the court\u2019s jurisdiction, and that sibling visitation is not contrary to the safety and well-being of any of the siblings, the court may grant the request after following the procedures in (f), (g), and (h).  (4) If the petition is filed under section 778(b), the request is for visitation with a sibling who is not a dependent of the court and who is in the custody of a parent subject to the court\u2019s jurisdiction, and that sibling visitation is not contrary to the safety and well being of the ward or any of the siblings, the court may grant the request after following the procedures in (f), (g), and (i).   340 (5) For a petition filed under section 388(c)(1)(A), the court may terminate reunification services during the time periods described in section 388(c)(1) only if the court finds by a preponderance of evidence that reasonable services have been offered or provided, and, by clear and convincing evidence, that the change of circumstance or new evidence described in the petition satisfies a condition in section 361.5(b) or (e). In the case of an Indian child, the court may terminate reunification services only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family within the meaning of sections 224.1(f) and 361.7 and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful. The court may grant the petition after following the procedures in (f), (g), and (h).  (6) For a petition filed under section 388(c)(1)(B), the court may terminate reunification services during the time periods described in section 388(c)(1) only if the court finds by a preponderance of evidence that reasonable services have been offered or provided, and, by clear and convincing evidence, that action or inaction by the parent or guardian creates a substantial likelihood that reunification will not occur. Such action or inaction includes, but is not limited to, failure to visit the child or failure to participate regularly and make substantive progress in a court-ordered treatment program. In determining whether the parent or guardian has failed to visit the child or to participate regularly or make progress in a court-ordered treatment plan, the court must consider factors including, but not limited to, the parent or guardian\u2019s incarceration, institutionalization, or participation in a residential substance abuse treatment program. In the case of an Indian child, the court may terminate reunification services only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family within the meaning of sections 224.1(f) and 361.7 and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful. The court may grant the petition after following the procedures in (f), (g), and (h).  (7) If the petition filed under section 388(a) is filed before an order terminating parental rights and is seeking to modify an order that reunification services need not be provided under section 361.5(b)(4), (5), or (6) or to modify any orders related to custody or visitation of the child for whom reunification services were not ordered under section 361.5(b)(4), (5), or (6), the court may modify the orders only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed change is in the best interests of the child. The court may grant the petition after following the procedures in (f), (g), and (h).   341 (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2020; adopted as subd (c); previously amended and relettered as subd (e) effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2010, January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2016.)  (f) Hearing on petition  If all parties stipulate to the requested modification, the court may order modification without a hearing. If there is no such stipulation and the petition has not been denied ex parte under section (d), the court must either:  (1) order that a hearing on the petition be held within 30 calendar days after the petition is filed; or  (2) order a hearing for the parties to argue whether an evidentiary hearing on the petition should be granted or denied. If the court then grants an evidentiary hearing on the petition, that hearing must be held within 30 calendar days after the petition is filed.

(g) Notice of petition and hearing (\u00a7\u00a7 388, 778)  (1) If a petition is filed under section 388 or section 778 to terminate juvenile court jurisdiction over a nonminor, notice of the hearing must be given as required by section 295.  (2) For hearings on all other petitions filed under section 388 or section 778, notice of the hearing must be provided as required under section 297, or sections 776 and 779, except that notice to parents or former guardians of a nonminor must be provided only if the nonminor requests, in writing on the face of the petition, that such notice be provided, or if the parent or legal guardian is receiving court-ordered family reunification services.

(B) If the request is for termination of court-ordered reunification services, the petitioner must show by clear and convincing evidence that one of the conditions in section 388(c)(1)(A) or (B) exists and must show by a preponderance of the evidence that reasonable services have been offered or provided. In the case of an Indian child, the court may terminate reunification services only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family within the meaning of sections 224.1(f) and 361.7 and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.  (C) If the request is to modify an order that reunification services were not ordered under section 361.5(b)(4), (5), or (6) or to modify any orders related to custody or visitation of the child for whom reunification services were not ordered under section 361.5(b)(4), (5), or (6), the petitioner must show by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed change is in the best interests of the child.  (D) All other requests require a preponderance of the evidence to show that the child\u2019s welfare requires such a modification  \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}

Advisory Committee Comment  Juvenile court judicial officers throughout the state have expressed concern that in determining whether or not to transfer a juvenile court case, the best interest of the subject child is being overlooked or at least outweighed by a desire to shift the financial burdens of case management and foster care. The advisory committee has clarified rule 5.610 in order to stress that in considering an intercounty transfer, as in all matters relating to children within its jurisdiction, the court has a mandate to act in the best interest of the subject children.  Juvenile Court Transfer-Out Orders  (form JV-550) was adopted for mandatory use commencing January 1, 1992. Although the finding regarding the best interest of the child was noted on the original form, the language has been emphasized on the amended form.  Rule 5.612.

Rule 5.613.  Transfer of nonminor dependents  (a) Purpose  This rule applies to requests to transfer the county of jurisdiction of a nonminor dependent as allowed by Welfare and Institutions Code section 375. This rule sets forth the procedures that a court is to follow when it seeks to order a transfer of a nonminor dependent and those to be followed by the court receiving the transfer. All other intercounty transfers of juveniles are subject to rules 5.610 and 5.612.  (b) Transfer-out hearing  (1) Determination of residence\u2014special rule on intercounty transfers (\u00a7\u00a7 17.1, 375)   (A) For purposes of this rule, the residence of a nonminor dependent who is placed in a planned permanent living arrangement may be either the county in which the court that has jurisdiction over the nonminor is located or the county in which the nonminor has resided continuously for at least one year as a nonminor dependent and the nonminor dependent has expressed his or her intent to remain.  (B) If a nonminor dependent\u2019s dependency jurisdiction has been resumed, or if transition jurisdiction has been assumed or resumed by the juvenile court that retained general jurisdiction over the nonminor under section 303, the county that the nonminor dependent is residing  358 in may be deemed the county of residence of the nonminor dependent. The court may make this determination if the nonminor has established a continuous physical presence in the county for one year as a nonminor and has expressed his or her intent to remain in that county after the court grants the petition to resume jurisdiction. The period of continuous physical presence includes any period of continuous residence immediately before filing the petition.  (2) Verification of residence   The residence of a nonminor may be verified by declaration of a social worker or probation officer in the transferring or receiving county.  (3) Transfer to county of nonminor\u2019s residence (\u00a7 375)  If the court is resuming dependency jurisdiction or assuming or resuming transition jurisdiction of a nonminor for whom the court has retained general jurisdiction under section 303(b) as a result of a petition filed under section 388(e), after granting the petition, the court may order the transfer of the case to the juvenile court of the county in which the nonminor is living if the nonminor establishes residency in that county as provided in (b)(1) and the court finds that the transfer is in the minor\u2019s best interest.  (4) Transfer on change in nonminor\u2019s residence (\u00a7 375)  If a nonminor dependent under the dependency or transition jurisdiction of the court is placed in a planned permanent living arrangement in a county other than the county with jurisdiction over the nonminor, the court may, on an application for modification under rule 5.570, transfer the case to the juvenile court of the county in which the nonminor is living if the nonminor establishes residency in that county as provided in (b)(1).  (5) Conduct of hearing   (A) The request for transfer must be made on Motion for Transfer Out  (form JV-548), which must include all required information.  (B) After the court determines whether a nonminor has established residency in another county as required in (b)(1), the court must consider whether transfer of the case would be in the nonminor\u2019s best interest. The court may not transfer the case unless it determines that the nonminor supports the transfer and that the transfer will protect or further the nonminor\u2019s best interest.  359  (C) If the transfer-out motion is granted, the sending court must set a date certain for the transfer-in hearing in the receiving court, which must be within 10 court days of the transfer-out order. The sending court must state on the record the date, time, and location of the hearing in the receiving court.  (6) Order of transfer (\u00a7 377)   The order of transfer must be entered on Juvenile Court Transfer-Out Orders\u2014Nonminor Dependent  (form JV-552), which must include all required information and findings.  (7) Modification of form JV-552   Juvenile Court Transfer-Out Orders\u2014Nonminor Dependent  (form JV-552) may be modified as follows:  (A) Notwithstanding the mandatory use of form JV-552, the form may be modified for use by a formalized regional collaboration of courts to facilitate the efficient processing of transfer cases among those courts if the modification has been approved by the Judicial Council.  \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}

Code, \u00a7 7900 et seq.)  This rule implements the purposes and provisions of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC, or the compact). California juvenile courts must apply this rule when placing children who are dependents or wards of the juvenile court and for whom placement is indicated in any other state, the District of Columbia, or the U.S. Virgin Islands.  (1) This rule applies to expedited placements as described in (h).  (2) This rule does not apply to placements made under the Interstate Compact for Juveniles (Welf. & Inst. Code, \u00a7 1400 et seq.).  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2013; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Definitions (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7900 et seq.; ICPC Regulations)  (1) \u201cPlacement\u201d is defined in article 2(d) of the compact. It includes placements with a relative, as defined in Regulation No. 3, paragraph 4, item 56; a legal  364 guardian of the child; a placement recipient who is not related to the child; or a residential facility or group home as defined in Regulation No. 4.  (A) A court\u2019s directing or making an award of custody to a parent of the child or placing a child with his or her parent is not a placement requiring compliance with this rule.  (B) The following situations each constitute a placement, and the compact must be applied:  (i) An order causing a child to be sent or brought to a person, other than a parent, in a compact jurisdiction without a specific date of return to the sending jurisdiction;  (ii) An order causing a child to be sent or brought to a person, other than a parent, in a compact jurisdiction with a return date more than 30 days from the start of the visit or beyond the ending date of a school vacation period, under Regulation No. 9;  (iii) An out-of-state placement for the purpose of an anticipated adoption, whether independent, private, or public;  (iv) An out-of-state placement with a related or unrelated caregiver in a licensed or approved foster home;  (v) An out-of-state placement with relatives, except when a parent or relative sends or brings the child to the relative's home in the receiving state, as defined in article 8(a) of the ICPC; or  (vi) An out-of-state group home or residential placement of any child, including a child adjudicated delinquent.  (2) \u201cChild,\u201d for the purposes of ICPC placement, includes nonminor dependents up to age 21. If a California nonminor dependent is to be placed out of state, the placing county may request supervision from the receiving state, but such services are discretionary.

{"prompt": " (d) Notice of intention; authorization (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7901)  A sending jurisdiction must provide to the designated receiving jurisdiction written notice of intention to place the child, using Form ICPC-100A: Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children Request.  (1) The representative of the receiving jurisdiction may request and receive additional information as the representative deems necessary.  (2) The child must not be placed until the receiving jurisdiction has determined that the placement is not contrary to the interest of the child and has so notified the sending jurisdiction in writing.   366 (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2013; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)

(2) The ICPC does not apply when the family with whom the child is placed relocates to another state and there will be no ongoing supervision by the sending state or the relocation will be temporary (90 days or less) and will not recur.  (3) Additional procedural requirements for cases involving relocation of family units are in ICPC Regulation No. 1.

No. 2, \u00a7 3)  When a child will be placed with his or her parent in another state, compliance with the requirements of the ICPC is not required. However, the court has discretion to take the steps it deems necessary to ensure the child\u2019s safety and well-being in that placement. Those steps may include:  (1) Directing the child welfare agency to request an independent, non-ICPC home study or courtesy check;  (2) Directing the child welfare agency to enter into a contract with a public or private agency in the receiving state to obtain a home study or other needed information;  (3) Directing the child welfare agency to enter into an informal agreement with a public or private agency in the receiving state, or requesting a courtesy check from such an agency, to obtain needed information; or  (4) Any other steps that the court deems necessary to ensure the child\u2019s safety and well-being.

(2) Before the court orders an expedited placement, the court must make express findings that the child is a dependent child removed from and no longer residing in the home of a parent and now being considered for placement in another state with a stepparent, grandparent, adult aunt or uncle, adult sibling, or legal guardian. In addition, the court must find that the child to be placed meets at least one of the following criteria:  (A) Unexpected dependency due to the sudden or recent incarceration, incapacitation, or death of a parent or guardian. Incapacitation  means  368 the parent or guardian is unable to care for the child due to the parent\u2019s medical, mental, or physical condition;  (B) The child is 4 years of age or younger;  (C) The child is part of a group of siblings who will be placed together, where one or more of the siblings is 4 years of age or younger;  (D) The child to be placed, or any of the child\u2019s siblings in a sibling group to be placed, has a substantial relationship with the proposed placement resource as defined in section 5(c) of Regulation No. 7; or  (E) The child is in an emergency placement.  (3) Before the court orders an expedited placement, the child welfare agency must provide to the court, at a minimum, the documents required by section 7(a) and (b) of Regulation No. 7:  (A) A signed statement of interest from the potential placement, or a written statement from the assigned case manager affirming that the potential placement resource confirms appropriateness for the ICPC expedited placement decision process. The statement must include all items listed in Regulation No. 7, section 7(a); and  (B) A statement from the assigned case manager or other child welfare agency representative stating that he or she knows of no reason why the child could not be placed with the proposed placement and that the agency has completed and is prepared to send all required paperwork.  (4) On findings of the court under (h)(2) and (3) that the child meets the criteria for an expedited placement and that the required statements have been provided to the court, the case must proceed as follows:  (A) The court must enter an order for expedited placement, stating on the record or in the written order the factual basis for that order. If the court is also requesting provisional approval of the proposed placement, the court must so order, and must state on the record or in the written order the factual basis for that request.  (B) The court\u2019s findings and orders must be noted in a written order using Expedited Placement Under the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children: Findings and Orders  (form JV-567), which must include  369 the name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and fax number of the clerk of court or designated court administrator.  (C) The order must be transmitted by the court to the sending agency of the court\u2019s jurisdiction within 2 business days of the hearing or consideration of the request.  (D) The sending child welfare agency must be ordered to transmit to the county ICPC Liaison in the sending jurisdiction within 3 business days of receipt of the order the following:  (i) A copy of the completed Expedited Placement Under the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children: Findings and Orders (form JV-567); and  (ii) A completed Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children Request (form ICPC-100A), along with form ICPC-101, the statements required under section (h)(3), above, and all required supporting documentation.  (E) Within 2 business days after receipt of the paperwork, the county ICPC Liaison of the sending jurisdiction must transmit the documents described in (D) to the compact administrator of the receiving jurisdiction with a request for an expedited placement decision, as well as any request for provisional placement.  (5) The compact administrator of the receiving jurisdiction must determine immediately, and no later than 20 business days after receipt, whether the placement is approved and must transmit the completed written report and form ICPC 100A, as required by Regulation 7, section 9, to the county ICPC Liaison in the sending jurisdiction.  (6) The transmission of any documentation, request for information, or decision may be by overnight mail, fax, e-mail, or other recognized, secure method of communication. The receiving state may also request original documents or certified copies if it considers them necessary for a legally sufficient record.  (7) When California is the sending state and there appears to be a lack of compliance with Regulation No. 7 requirements by state officials or the local child welfare agency in the receiving state regarding the expedited placement request, the California judicial officer may communicate directly with the judicial officer in the receiving state.   370 (A) This communication may be by telephone, e-mail, or any other recognized, secure communication method.  (B) The California judicial officer may do any one or more of the following:  (i) Contact the appropriate judicial officer in the receiving state to discuss the situation and possible solutions.  (ii) Provide, or direct someone else to provide, the judicial officer of the receiving state with copies of relevant documents and court orders.  (iii) Request assistance with obtaining compliance.  (iv) Use Request for Assistance With Expedited Placement Under the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Childr en (form JV-565) to communicate the request for assistance to the receiving state judicial officer. When this form is used, a copy should be provided to the county ICPC Liaison in the sending jurisdiction.  (8) All other requirements, exceptions, timelines, and instructions for expedited placement cases, along with procedures for provisional approval or denial of a placement and for removal of a child from the placement, are stated in Regulation No. 7.

(i) Authority of sending court or agency to place child; timing (ICPC Reg. No. 2, \u00a7 8(d), and Reg. No. 4, \u00a7 8)  (1) When the receiving state has approved a placement resource, the sending court has the final authority to determine whether to use the approved placement resource. The sending court may delegate that decision to the sending state child welfare agency or probation department.  (2) For proposed placements of children for adoption, in foster care, or with relatives, the receiving state\u2019s approval expires six months from the date form ICPC-100A was signed by the receiving state.  (3) For proposed placements of children in residential facilities or group homes, the receiving state\u2019s approval expires 30 calendar days from the date form  371 ICPC-100A was signed by the receiving state. The 30-day time frame can be extended by mutual agreement between the sending and receiving states.  (Subd (i) amended effective January 1, 2014; adopted effective January 1, 2013.)  (j) Ongoing jurisdiction  If a child is placed in another jurisdiction under the terms of the compact, the sending court must not terminate its jurisdiction until the child is adopted, reaches majority, or is emancipated, or the dependency is terminated with the concurrence of the receiving state authority.

{"prompt": "January 1, 2013.  Advisory Committee Comment  Urgency of ICPC Matters. Implementation of the ICPC has long frustrated judicial officers and other professionals. The overriding concern is that the process takes too long, and children cannot wait. In all ICPC actions, there should be a sense of urgency, and all professionals involved should take action as quickly as possible.  Subdivision (h)(7).  Judicial officers requesting assistance under subdivision (h)(7) from the receiving state judge or judicial officer should be cognizant of ethical concerns raised by such ex parte communication. These concerns can be addressed in various ways, including but not limited to using form JV-565, obtaining a stipulation from all parties to permit judge-to-judge phone or e-mail contact, or conducting the discussion by phone with parties and a court reporter present.

(1) Any alleged father and his counsel must complete and submit Statement Regarding Parentage (Juvenile) (form JV-505). Form JV-505 must be made available in the courtroom.  (2) To determine parentage, the juvenile court may order the child and any alleged parents to submit to genetic tests and proceed under Family Code section 7550 et seq.  (3) The court may make its determination of parentage or nonparentage based on the testimony, declarations, or statements of the alleged parents. The court must advise any alleged parent that if parentage is determined, the parent will have responsibility for the financial support of the child, and, if the child  388 receives welfare benefits, the parent may be subject to an action to obtain support payments.

Rule 5.642. Authorization to release psychotropic medication prescription information to Medical Board of California  (a) Providing authorization forms   Whenever there is an Application for Psychotropic Medication (form JV-220) filed with the court under rule 5.640, the applicant must review the Physician\u2019s Statement\u2014Attachment (form JV-220(A)) or Physician\u2019s Request to Continue Medication\u2014Attachment (form JV-220(B)) to determine if the request would result in the child being prescribed three or more concurrent psychotropic medications for 90 days or more, as described in section 14028.

Mental health or condition of child; court procedures  (a) Doubt concerning the mental health of a child (\u00a7\u00a7 357, 705, 6550, 6551)  Whenever the court believes that the child who is the subject of a petition filed under section 300, 601, or 602 is mentally disabled or may be mentally ill, the court  402 may stay the proceedings and order the child taken to a facility designated by the court and approved by the State Department of Mental Health as a facility for 72-hour treatment and evaluation. The professional in charge of the facility must submit a written evaluation of the child to the court.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Findings regarding a mental disorder (\u00a7 6551)  Article 1 of chapter 2 of part 1 of division 5 (commencing with section 5150) applies.  (1) If the professional reports that the child is not in need of intensive treatment, the child must be returned to the juvenile court on or before the expiration of the 72-hour period, and the court must proceed with the case under section 300, 601, or 602.  (2) If the professional in charge of the facility finds that the child is in need of intensive treatment for a mental disorder, the child may be certified for not more than 14 days of involuntary intensive treatment according to the conditions of sections 5250(c) and 5260(b). The stay of the juvenile court proceedings must remain in effect during this time.  (A) During or at the end of the 14 days of involuntary intensive treatment, a certification may be sought for additional treatment under sections commencing with 5270.10 or for the initiation of proceedings to have a conservator appointed for the child under sections commencing with 5350. The juvenile court may retain jurisdiction over the child during proceedings under sections 5270.10 et seq. and 5350 et seq.  (B) For a child subject to a petition under section 602, if the child is found to be gravely disabled under sections 5300 et seq., a conservator is appointed under those sections, and the professional in charge of the child\u2019s treatment or of the treatment facility determines that proceedings under section 602 would be detrimental to the child, the juvenile court must suspend jurisdiction while the conservatorship remains in effect. The suspension of jurisdiction may end when the conservatorship is terminated, and the original 602 matter may be calendared for further proceedings.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)   403 (c) Findings regarding developmental disability (\u00a7 6551)  Article 1 of chapter 2 of part 1 of division 5 (commencing with section 5150) applies.  (1) If the professional finds that the child has a developmental disability and recommends commitment to a state hospital, the court may direct the filing in the appropriate court of a petition for commitment of a child who has a developmental disability to the State Department of Developmental Services for placement in a state hospital.  (2) If the professional finds that the child does not have a developmental disability, the child must be returned to the juvenile court on or before the expiration of the 72-hour period, and the court must proceed with the case under section 300, 601, or 602.  (3) The jurisdiction of the juvenile court must be suspended while the child is subject to the jurisdiction of the appropriate court under a petition for commitment of a person who has a developmental disability, or under remand for 90 days for intensive treatment or commitment ordered by that court.

Evidence is substantial if it raises a reasonable doubt about the child\u2019s competence to stand trial.  (A) The court must appoint an expert to examine the child to evaluate whether the child suffers from a mental disorder, developmental disability, developmental immaturity, or other condition and, if so, whether the condition or conditions impair the child\u2019s competency.  (B) To be appointed as an expert, an individual must be a:   404 (i) Licensed psychiatrist who has successfully completed four years of medical school and either four years of general psychiatry residency, including one year of internship and two years of child and adolescent fellowship training, or three years of general psychiatry residency, including one year of internship and one year of residency that focus on children and adolescents and one year of child and adolescent fellowship training; or  (ii) Clinical, counseling, or school psychologist who has received a doctoral degree in psychology from an educational institution accredited by an organization recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation and who is licensed as a psychologist.  (C) The expert, whether a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist, must:  (i) Possess demonstrable professional experience addressing child and adolescent developmental issues, including the emotional, behavioral, and cognitive impairments of children and adolescents;  (ii) Have expertise in the cultural and social characteristics of children and adolescents;  (iii) Possess a curriculum vitae reflecting training and experience in the forensic evaluation of children;  (iv) Be familiar with juvenile competency standards and accepted criteria used in evaluating juvenile competence;  (v) Possess a comprehensive understanding of effective interventions as well as treatment, training, and programs for the attainment of competency available to children and adolescents; and  (vi) Be proficient in the language preferred by the child, or if that is not feasible, employ the services of a certified interpreter and use assessment tools that are linguistically and culturally appropriate for the child.  (2) Nothing in this rule precludes involvement of clinicians with other professional qualifications from participation as consultants or witnesses or in other capacities relevant to the case.   405 (3) Following the hearing on competence, the court must proceed as directed in section 709.

(I)  A recommendation, as appropriate, for a placement or type of placement, services, and treatment that would be most appropriate for the child to attain or restore competence. The recommendation must be guided by the principle of section 709 that services must be provided in the least restrictive environment consistent with public safety.   (J) If the expert is of the opinion that a referral to a psychiatrist is appropriate, the expert must inform the court of this opinion and recommend that a psychiatrist examine the child.   (2) Statements made to the appointed expert during the child\u2019s competency evaluation and statements made by the child to mental health professionals during the remediation proceedings, and any fruits of these statements, must not be used in any other hearing against the child in either juvenile or adult court.   410 Rule 5.645 adopted effective January 1, 2020.   Rule 5.647.  Medi-Cal: Presumptive Transfer of Specialty Mental Health Services  (a) Applicability  This rule applies to the court\u2019s review under Welfare and Institutions Code section 14717.1 of the presumptive transfer of responsibility to arrange and provide for a child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s specialty mental health services to the child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s county of residence. The rule applies to presumptive transfer following any change of placement within California for a child or nonminor to a placement that is outside the county of original jurisdiction, including the initial placement. Nothing in this rule relieves the placing agency of the reporting requirements and duties under section 14717.1 when no hearing under this rule is held.  (b) Requesting a hearing to review the request for waiver of presumptive transfer (\u00a7 14717.1)  (1) The following persons or agencies may make a request to the placing agency that presumptive transfer be waived and that the responsibility for providing specialty mental health services remain in the child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s county of original jurisdiction:  (A) The foster child or nonminor;  (B) The person or agency that is responsible for making mental health care decisions on behalf of the foster child or nonminor;  (C) The child welfare services agency or the probation agency with responsibility for the care and placement of the child or nonminor; and  (D) Any other interested party who owes a legal duty to the child or nonminor involving the child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s health or welfare, as defined by the department.  (2) The person or agency who requested the waiver, or any other party to the case who disagrees with the placing agency\u2019s determination on the request for the waiver of presumptive transfer, may request a judicial review of the placing agency\u2019s determination.  (3) A request for a hearing must be made by filing a Request for Hearing on Waiver of Presumptive Transfer (form JV-214). If a hearing is requested,  411 form JV-214 must be provided to the placing agency within seven court days of the petitioner\u2019s being noticed of the placing agency\u2019s determination on the request for waiver of presumptive transfer.  (4) When a hearing is requested in (b)(3), the transfer of the responsibility for providing specialty mental health services cannot occur until the court makes a ruling as required in (c)(1).  (c) Setting of a hearing (\u00a7 14717.1)  (1) The court on its own motion may direct the clerk to set a hearing no later than five court days after the request for a hearing was filed, or may deny the request for a hearing without ruling on the transfer of jurisdiction.  (2) If the court sets a hearing, the clerk must provide notice of the hearing date to:  (A) The parents\u2014unless parental rights have been terminated\u2014or guardians of the child;  (B) The petitioner;  (C) The social worker or probation officer;  (D) The mental health care decision maker for the child or nonminor, if one \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
{"prompt": " (E) The Indian child\u2019s tribe, if applicable, as defined in rule 5.502;  (F) The child\u2014if 10 years of age or older\u2014or nonminor; and  (G) All other persons entitled to notice under section 293 or section 727.4(a).  (3) If the court grants a hearing under (c)(1), responsibility for providing specialty mental health services cannot be transferred until the court makes a ruling as required in (e)(2) and section 14717.1(d)(4).  (d) Reports  When a hearing is granted under (c)(1), the social worker or probation officer must provide a report including discussion or documentation of the following:   412 (1) The placing agency\u2019s rationale for its decision on the request for a waiver of presumptive transfer, including:  (A) Any requests for waiver, and the exceptions claimed as the basis for those requests;  (B) The placing agency\u2019s determination of whether waiver of presumptive transfer is appropriate under section 14717.1(d)(5)(A)\u2013(D);  (C) Any objections to the placing agency\u2019s determination in (B); and  (D) The ways that the child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s best interests will be promoted by the placing agency\u2019s presumptive transfer determination.  (2) That the child or nonminor, his or her parents if applicable, the child and family team, and others who serve the child or nonminor as appropriate\u2014such as the therapist, mental health care decision maker for the child or nonminor if one has been appointed under section 361(a)(1), and Court Appointed Special Advocate volunteer\u2014were consulted regarding the waiver determination.  (3) That notice of the placing agency\u2019s determination of whether to waive presumptive transfer was provided to the individual who requested waiver of presumptive transfer, along with all parties to the case.  (4) Whether the mental health plan in the county of original jurisdiction demonstrates an existing contract with a specialty mental health care provider, or the ability to enter into a contract with a specialty mental health care provider within 30 days of the waiver decision, and the ability to deliver timely specialty mental health services directly to the foster child or nonminor.  (5) The child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s current provision of specialty mental health services, and how those services will be affected by the placing agency\u2019s presumptive transfer determination.  (e) Conduct at the hearing  (1) The social worker or probation officer must provide the report in (d) to the court, all parties to the case, and the person or agency that requested the waiver no later than two court days after the hearing is set under (c)(1).   413 (2) At the hearing, the court may confirm or deny the transfer of jurisdiction or application of an exception based on the best interests of the child or nonminor. A waiver of presumptive transfer is contingent on the mental health plan in the county of original jurisdiction demonstrating an existing contract with a specialty mental health care provider, or the ability to enter into such a contract within 30 days of the waiver decision, and the ability to deliver timely specialty mental health services directly to the child or nonminor.  (3) The person or agency that requested the waiver of presumptive transfer bears the burden to show that an exception to presumptive transfer is in the best interests of the child or nonminor by a preponderance of the evidence.  (4) The hearing must conclude within five court days of the initial hearing date, unless a showing of good cause consistent with section 352 or section 682 supports a continuance of the hearing beyond five days.  (5) When considering whether it is in the child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s best interests to confirm or deny the request for a waiver of presumptive transfer, the court may consider the following in addition to any other factors the court deems relevant:  (A) The child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s access to specialty mental health services, the current provision of specialty mental health services to the child or nonminor, and whether any important service relationships will be affected by the transfer of jurisdiction or a waiver of presumptive transfer;  (B) If reunification services are being provided, the impact that the transfer of jurisdiction would have on reunification services;  (C) The anticipated length of stay in the child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s new placement;  (D) The position of the child or nonminor, or of the child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s attorney, on presumptive transfer; and  (E) The ability to maintain specialty mental health services in the county of original jurisdiction or to arrange for specialty mental health services in the county of residence after the child or nonminor changes placements.  (6) Findings and orders must be made on Order after Hearing on Waiver of Presumptive Transfer  (form JV-215).  414  (f) Existing out-of-county placement  This rule applies to presumptive transfer for any child or nonminor who resided in a county other than the county of original jurisdiction after June 30, 2017, and who continues to reside outside his or her county of original jurisdiction after December 31, 2017, and has not had a presumptive transfer determination as required under Welfare and Institutions Code section 14717.1(c)(2). Unless amended by Judicial Council action effective after the effective date of this rule, this subdivision will be repealed effective January 1, 2020.  Rule 5.647 adopted effective September 1, 2018.  Advisory Committee Comment  The exceptions to the presumptive transfer of the responsibility to provide for and arrange for specialty mental health services to the county of the child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s out-of-county residence are found in Welfare and Institutions Code section 14717.1(d)(5)(A\u2013D). A court review hearing under this rule may not necessarily be common, but under section 14717.1(d)(7), for all cases, a request for waiver, the exceptions claimed as the basis for the request, a determination whether a waiver is appropriate under Welfare and Institutions Code section 14717.1, and any objections to the determination must be documented in the child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s case plan under Welfare and Institutions Code section 16501.1. The Department of Health Care Services and California Department of Social Services are responsible for providing policy guidance and regulations to implement Assembly Bill 1299 (Ridley-Thomas; Stats. 2016, ch. 603). The policy guidance and regulations should be used during the administrative process related to presumptive transfer. This would include determining who is entitled to make a request for waiver under (b)(1)(D) of the rule and section 14717.1(d)(2), where \u201cdepartment\u201d refers to the Department of Health Care Services. In the policy guidance and regulations, the Department of Health Care Services and California Department of Social Services will determine who owes a legal duty to the child or nonminor and thus may request a waiver of presumptive transfer. In addition, the policy guidance and regulations will address the timelines for the period to request a hearing. Presumptive transfer cannot occur until the court has made a ruling on the request for a hearing, and if a hearing is granted, makes a ruling as required in (c)(3). In accordance with the policy guidance issued by the Department of Health Care Services and California Department of Social Services, the delivery of existing specialty mental health services to the child or nonminor must however continue without interruption, and be provided or arranged for, and paid for by the Mental Health Plan in the county of original jurisdiction until the court makes a ruling on the request for a hearing or makes a ruling as required in (c)(3) if a hearing is granted.  415   Rule 5.649.  Right to make educational or developmental-services decisions  The court must identify the educational rights holder for the child at each hearing in a juvenile dependency or juvenile justice proceeding. At any hearing, where the court limits, restores, or modifies educational rights, or where there are updates to any contact or other information, in any juvenile proceeding, the findings and orders must be documented on form JV-535. Unless the rights of the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian have been limited by the court under this rule, the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian holds the educational and developmental-services decisionmaking rights for the child. In addition, a nonminor or nonminor dependent youth holds the rights to mae educational and developmental-services decisions for the youth and should be identified on form JV-535, unless rule 5.650(b) applies.   (a) Order (\u00a7\u00a7 361, 366, 366.27, 366.3, 726, 727.2; 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415; 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.300)  At the dispositional hearing and each subsequent review or permanency hearing, the court must determine whether the rights of a parent, guardian, or Indian custodian to make educational or developmental-services decisions for the child should be limited.  If necessary to protect a child who is adjudged a dependent or ward of the court under section 300, 601, or 602, the court may limit the rights of a parent,  guardian, or Indian custodian to make educational or developmental-services decisions for the child by making appropriate, specific orders on Order Designating Educational Rights Holder (form JV-535).  (Subd (a) amended effective September 1, 2020.)  (b) Temporary order (\u00a7 319)  At the initial hearing on a petition filed under section 325 or at any time before a child is adjudged a dependent or the petition is dismissed, the court may, on making the findings required by section 319(g)(1), use form JV-535 to temporarily limit the rights of a parent, guardian, or Indian custodian to make educational or developmental-services decisions for the child. An order made under section 319(g) expires on dismissal of the petition, but in no circumstances later than the conclusion of the hearing held under section 361.  If the court does temporarily limit the rights of a parent, guardian, or Indian custodian to make educational or developmental-services decisions, the court must,  416 at the dispositional hearing, reconsider the need to limit those rights and must identify the authorized educational rights holder on form JV-535.  (Subd (b) amended effective September 1, 2020.)  (c) No delay of initial assessment  The child\u2019s initial assessment to determine any need for special education or developmental services need not be delayed to obtain parental or guardian consent or for the appointment of an educational rights holder if one or more of the following circumstances is met:  (1) The court has limited, even temporarily, the educational or developmental-services decisionmaking rights of the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian, and consent for an initial assessment has been given by an individual appointed by the court to represent the child;  (2) The local educational agency or regional center, after reasonable efforts, cannot locate the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian; or  (3) Parental rights have been terminated or the guardianship has been set aside.  (Subd (c) amended effective September 1, 2020.)  (d) Judicial Determination  If the court determines that the child is in need of any assessments, evaluations, or services\u2014including special education, mental health, developmental, and other related services\u2014the court must direct an appropriate person to take the necessary steps to request those assessments, evaluations, or services.  (e) Filing of order  Following the dispositional hearing and each statutory review hearing, the party that has requested a modification, limitation, or restoration of educational or developmental-services decisionmaking rights must complete form JV-535 and any required attachments to reflect the court\u2019s orders and submit the completed form \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}

(2) If the court refers a child to the local educational agency for appointment of a surrogate parent, the court must order that Local Educational Agency Response to JV-535\u2014Appointment of Surrogate Parent (form JV-536) be attached to form JV-535 and served by first-class mail on the local educational agency no later than five court days from the date the order is signed.  (3) The court must direct the local educational agency that when the agency receives form JV-535 requesting prompt appointment of a surrogate parent, the agency must make reasonable efforts to identify and appoint a surrogate parent within 30 calendar days of service of the referral.

The parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s educational and developmental-services decisionmaking rights are reinstated when the court returns custody to the parent or guardian unless the  421 court finds specifically that continued limitation of parental decisionmaking rights is necessary to protect the child.  (2) If the court appoints a guardian for the child under rule 5.735 or 5.815, all of the parent\u2019s or previous guardian\u2019s educational and developmental-services decisionmaking rights transfer to the newly appointed guardian unless the court determines that limitation of the new guardian\u2019s decisionmaking rights is necessary to protect the child.

Advisory Committee Comment  Under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the court may appoint a surrogate parent to speak and act on behalf of a pupil in all matters relating to the identification, evaluation, and educational placement of the child and to the provision of the child\u2019s free, appropriate public education. (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(b)(2); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.519.) Under Welfare and Institutions Code sections 361 and 726, the court must appoint a responsible adult as an educational representative or rights holder to make decisions regarding the child\u2019s educational or developmental-services needs when the parent\u2019s rights to make those decisions have been limited. A court-appointed educational rights holder is responsible for protecting the child\u2019s rights and interests with respect to educational or developmental services, including any special education and related services.  If the court limits the parent\u2019s decisionmaking rights and cannot identify a responsible adult to appoint as educational rights holder, and the appointment of a surrogate parent is not warranted, sections 361 and 726 authorize the court to make educational or developmental-services decisions for the child with the input of interested persons. If, however, the court cannot identify a responsible adult to appoint as educational rights holder and there is reason to believe that the child needs special education and related services, the court must refer the child to the local educational agency (LEA) for the appointment of a surrogate parent. Sections 361 and 726 do not  428 authorize the court to make educational decisions for a child in these circumstances. The surrogate parent appointed by the LEA acts as a parent for the purpose of making decisions with respect to special education and related services and the provision of a free, appropriate public education on behalf of the child. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7579.5(c); Ed. Code, \u00a7 56028; 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.30(b)(2); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401(9), 1414(d).) If, however, the LEA does not appoint a surrogate parent in a timely manner, the court has the authority to join the LEA in the dependency proceedings under section 362 and rule 5.575. In the period between the setting of the joinder hearing and the appointment of a surrogate parent by the LEA, the court may make educational decisions for the child under the general authority granted by section 362(a).

(2) At the dispositional hearing and at all subsequent hearings described in (a)(2), the court must:  (A) Consider and determine whether the child\u2019s or youth\u2019s educational, physical, mental health, and developmental needs, including any need for special education and related services, are being met;  (B) Identify the educational rights holder on form JV-535; and  (C) Direct the rights holder to take all appropriate steps to ensure that the child\u2019s or youth\u2019s educational and developmental needs are met.

(H) Whether the parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s educational or developmental-services decisionmaking rights should be limited or, if previously limited, whether those rights should be restored.   431 (i) If the court finds that the parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s educational or developmental-services decisionmaking rights should not be limited or should be restored, the court must explain to the parent or guardian his or her rights and responsibilities in regard to the child\u2019s education and developmental services as provided in rule 5.650(e), (f), and (j); or  (ii) If the court finds that the parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s educational or developmental-services decisionmaking rights should be or remain limited, the court must designate the holder of those rights.

(Subd (f) amended effective January 1, 2014.)  Rule 5.651 amended effective January 1, 2014; adopted effective January 1, 2008.  Advisory Committee Comment  A child or youth in, or at risk of entering, foster care has a statutory right to a meaningful opportunity to meet the state\u2019s academic achievement standards. To protect this right, the juvenile court, advocates, placing agencies, care providers, educators, and service providers must work together to maintain stable school placements and ensure that the child or youth is placed in the least restrictive educational programs and has access to the academic resources, services, and extracurricular and enrichment activities that are available to other pupils. This rule, sections 362 and 727, and rule 5.575 provide procedures for coordinating the provision of services to ensure that the child\u2019s or youth\u2019s educational and developmental-services needs are met.  Congress has found that improving the educational performance of children with disabilities is an essential prerequisite to ensuring their equality of opportunity, full participation in education, and economic self-sufficiency. Children and youth in foster care are disproportionately represented in the population of pupils with disabilities and face systemic challenges to attaining self-sufficiency. Children and youth in foster care have rights arising out of federal and state law, including the IDEA, the ADA, and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. To comply with federal requirements regarding the identification of children and youth with disabilities and the provision of services to those children and youth who qualify, the court, parent or guardian, placing agency, attorneys, CASA volunteer, local educational agencies, and educational rights holders must affirmatively address the child\u2019s or youth\u2019s educational and developmental-services needs. The court must continually inquire about the educational and developmental-services needs of the child or youth and the progress being made to enforce any rights the child or youth has under these laws.

CASA programs provide substantial benefits to children appearing in dependency proceedings and to the juvenile court having responsibility for these children. Child advocates improve the quality of judicial decision making by providing information to the court concerning the child. Advocates help identify needed services for the children they are assisting and provide a consistent friend and support person for children throughout the long and complex dependency process.  The CASA concept was first implemented in Seattle in 1977. As of 1994, there were more than 30,000 volunteers working in more than 525 CASA programs in nearly every state. The programs recruit, screen, select, train, and supervise lay volunteers to become effective advocates in the juvenile court.  Currently, numerous jurisdictions in California use some variation of the CASA concept. These programs have developed over the past several years under the supervision of local juvenile courts under sections 356.5 and 358. Each program is unique and was designed to respond to the specific needs of the local jurisdiction and community it serves.  These guidelines provide a framework for ensuring the excellence of California CASA programs and volunteers. They are intended to be consistent with the guidelines established by the National CASA Association and to conform with the requirements of California law and procedure. The California CASA Association has assisted in developing these guidelines, which are meant to give the local bench, bar, child welfare professionals, children\u2019s advocates, and other interested citizens full rein to adapt the CASA concept to the special needs and circumstances of local communities.  Central to the intent of these guidelines is the effort to provide a vehicle for the presiding judge of the local juvenile court to exercise fully informed and effective oversight of the local CASA program and CASA volunteers. These guidelines are also intended to help CASA programs and juvenile courts develop local court rules. Nothing in these guidelines should limit or restrict the local juvenile court from developing and supporting multiple branches of a CASA program within the community to enable a county to offer comprehensive volunteer advocacy programs for children.   449 Rule 5.660.  Attorneys for parties (\u00a7\u00a7 317, 317.5, 317.6, 353, 366.26, 16010.6)  (a) Local rules  On or before January 1, 2002, the superior court of each county must amend its local rules regarding the representation of parties in dependency proceedings.

(2) Withdrawal from appointment or continued representation  (A) An attorney representing a group of siblings has an ongoing duty to evaluate the interests of each sibling and assess whether there is an actual conflict of interest.  (B) The following circumstances, standing alone, do not necessarily demonstrate an actual conflict of interest:  (i) The siblings are of different ages;  (ii) The siblings have different parents;  (iii) There is a purely theoretical or abstract conflict of interest among the siblings;  (iv) Some of the siblings are more likely to be adopted than others;  452  (v) The siblings have different permanent plans;  (vi) The siblings express conflicting desires or objectives, but the issues involved are not material to the case; or  (vii) The siblings give different or contradictory accounts of the events, but the issues involved are not material to the case.  (C) It is not necessary for an attorney to withdraw from representing some or all of the siblings if there is merely a reasonable likelihood that an actual conflict of interest will develop.  (D) If an attorney believes that an actual conflict of interest existed at appointment or developed during representation, the attorney must take any action necessary to ensure that the siblings\u2019 interests are not prejudiced, including:  (i) Notifying the juvenile court of the existence of an actual conflict of interest among some or all of the siblings; and  (ii) Requesting to withdraw from representation of some or all of the siblings.  (E) If the court determines that an actual conflict of interest exists, the court must relieve an attorney from representation of some or all of the siblings.

The attorney may give contact information to a child for whom a dependency petition has been filed who is under 10 years of age. At least once a year, if the list of educational liaisons is available online from the California Department of Education, the child\u2019s attorney must provide, in any manner permitted by section 317(e)(4), his or her contact information to the educational liaison of each local educational agency serving the attorney\u2019s clients in foster care in the county of jurisdiction.  (6) Caseloads for children\u2019s attorneys   The attorney for a child must have a caseload that allows the attorney to perform the duties required by section 317(e) and this rule, and to otherwise adequately counsel and represent the child. To enhance the quality of representation afforded to children, attorneys appointed under this rule must not maintain a maximum full-time caseload that is greater than that which allows them to meet the requirements stated in (3), (4), and (5).

Each party must be informed of the procedure for lodging the complaint. If it is determined that an appointed attorney has acted improperly or contrary to the rules or policies of the court, the court must take appropriate action.  (Subd (e) relettered effective January 1, 2006; adopted as subd (c); previously amended and relettered as subd (d) effective July 1, 2001.)  (f) CASA volunteer as CAPTA guardian ad litem (\u00a7 326.5)  If the court makes the findings as outlined in (b) and does not appoint an attorney to represent the child, the court must appoint a CASA volunteer as the CAPTA guardian ad litem of the child.  (1) The required training of CASA volunteers is stated in rule 5.655.  (2) The caseload of a CASA volunteer acting as a CAPTA guardian ad litem must be limited to 10 cases. A case may include siblings, absent a conflict.  (3) CASA volunteers must not assume the responsibilities of attorneys for children.  (4) The appointment of an attorney to represent the child does not prevent the appointment of a CASA volunteer for that child, and courts are encouraged to appoint both an attorney and a CASA volunteer for the child in as many cases as possible.  (Subd (f) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as subd (e) effective July 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2003; previously relettered effective January 1, 2006.)  (g) Interests of the child  At any time following the filing of a petition under section 300 and until juvenile court jurisdiction is terminated, any interested person may advise the court of information regarding an interest or right of the child to be protected or pursued in other judicial or administrative forums.    456 (1) Juvenile Dependency Petition (Version One) (form JV-100) and Request to Change Court Order  (form JV-180) may be used.  (2) If the attorney for the child, or a CASA volunteer acting as a CAPTA guardian ad litem, learns of any such interest or right, the attorney or CASA volunteer must notify the court immediately and seek instructions from the court as to any appropriate procedures to follow.  (3) If the court determines that further action on behalf of the child is required to protect or pursue any interests or rights, the court must appoint an attorney for the child, if the child is not already represented by counsel, and do one or all of the following:  (A) Refer the matter to the appropriate agency for further investigation and require a report to the court within a reasonable time;  (B) Authorize and direct the child\u2019s attorney to initiate and pursue appropriate action;  (C) Appoint a guardian ad litem for the child. The guardian may be the CASA volunteer already appointed as a CAPTA guardian ad litem or a person who will act only if required to initiate appropriate action; or  (D) Take any other action to protect or pursue the interests and rights of the child.

Advisory Committee Comment  The court should initially appoint a single attorney to represent all siblings in a dependency matter unless there is an actual conflict of interest or a reasonable likelihood that an actual conflict of interest will arise. ( In re Celine R. (2003) 31 Cal.4th 45, 58.) After the initial appointment, the court should relieve an attorney from representation of multiple siblings only if an actual conflict of interest arises. ( Ibid.)

{"prompt": "request withdrawal from appointment due to a purported conflict of interest.  Nothing in this rule is intended to extend the permissible scope of any judicial inquiry into an attorney\u2019s reasons for declining to represent one or more siblings or requesting to withdraw from representation of one or more siblings, due to an actual or reasonably likely conflict of interest. (See State Bar Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 3-310(C).) While the court has the duty and authority to inquire as to the general nature of an asserted conflict of interest, it cannot require an attorney to disclose any privileged communication, even if such information forms the basis of the alleged conflict. ( In re James S.  (1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 930, 934; Aceves v. Superior Court (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 584, 592\u2013593.)  Rule 5.661. Representation of the child on appeal  (a) Definition  For purposes of this rule, \u201cguardian ad litem\u201d means a person designated as the child\u2019s Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) guardian ad litem as defined in rule 5.662.  (b) Child as appellant  A notice of appeal on behalf of the child must be filed by the child\u2019s trial counsel, guardian ad litem, or the child if the child is seeking appellate relief from the trial court\u2019s judgment or order.  (c) Recommendation from child\u2019s trial counsel or guardian ad litem  (1) In any juvenile dependency proceeding in which a party other than the child files a notice of appeal, if the child\u2019s trial counsel or guardian ad litem concludes that, for purposes of the appeal, the child\u2019s best interests cannot be protected without the appointment of separate counsel on appeal, the child\u2019s trial counsel or guardian ad litem must file a recommendation in the Court of Appeal requesting appointment of separate counsel.  (2) A child\u2019s trial counsel or guardian ad litem who recommends appointment of appellate counsel for a child who is not an appellant must follow the procedures outlined in (d)\u2013(g).   458 (d) Time for trial counsel or guardian ad litem to file the recommendation with the Court of Appeal  A recommendation from the child\u2019s trial counsel or guardian ad litem may be filed at any time after a notice of appeal has been filed, but absent good cause, must be filed in the Court of Appeal no later than 20 calendar days after the filing of the last appellant\u2019s opening brief.  (e) Service of recommendation  The child\u2019s trial counsel or guardian ad litem must serve a copy of the recommendation filed in the Court of Appeal on the district appellate project and the trial court.  (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2015.)  (f) Factors to be considered  The following are factors to be considered by a child\u2019s trial counsel or guardian ad litem in making a recommendation to the Court of Appeal:  (1) An actual or potential conflict exists between the interests of the child and the interests of any respondent;  (2) The child did not have an attorney serving as his or her guardian ad litem in the trial court;  (3) The child is of a sufficient age or development such that he or she is able to understand the nature of the proceedings; and  (A) The child expresses a desire to participate in the appeal; or  (B) The child\u2019s wishes differ from his or her trial counsel\u2019s position;  (4) The child took a legal position in the trial court adverse to that of one of his or her siblings, and an issue has been raised in an appellant\u2019s opening brief regarding the siblings\u2019 adverse positions;  (5) The appeal involves a legal issue regarding a determination of parentage, the child\u2019s inheritance rights, educational rights, privileges identified in division 8 of the Evidence Code, consent to treatment, or tribal membership;   459 (6) Postjudgment evidence completely undermines the legal underpinnings of the juvenile court\u2019s judgment under review, and all parties recognize this and express a willingness to stipulate to reversal of the juvenile court\u2019s judgment;  (7) The child\u2019s trial counsel or guardian ad litem, after reviewing the appellate briefs, believes that the legal arguments contained in the respondents\u2019 briefs do not adequately represent or protect the best interests of the child; and  (8) The existence of any other factors relevant to the child\u2019s best interests.  (g) Form of recommendation  The child\u2019s trial counsel, the guardian ad litem, or the child may use Recommendation for Appointment of Appellate Attorney for Child (form JV-810). Any recommendation for an appellate attorney for the child must state a factual basis for the recommendation, include the information provided on form JV-810, and be signed under penalty of perjury.   Rule 5.661 amended effective January 1, 2015; adopted effective July 1, 2007.  Advisory Committee Comment  Generally, separate counsel for a nonappealing child will not be appointed for the purpose of introducing postjudgment evidence. See California Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 909; In re Zeth S . (2003) 31 Cal.4th 396; In re Josiah Z . (2005) 36 Cal.4th 664. For further discussion, see In re Mary C.  (1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 71.  Rule 5.662.  Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) guardian ad litem for a child subject to a juvenile dependency petition  (a) Authority  This rule is adopted under section 326.5.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Applicability  The definition of the role and responsibilities of a CAPTA guardian ad litem in this rule applies exclusively to juvenile dependency proceedings and is distinct from the definitions of guardian ad litem in all other juvenile, civil, and criminal proceedings. No limitation period for bringing an action based on an injury to the  460 child commences running solely by reason of the appointment of a CAPTA guardian ad litem under section 326.5 and this rule.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (c) Appointment  A CAPTA guardian ad litem must be appointed for every child who is the subject of a juvenile dependency petition under section 300. An attorney appointed under rule 5.660 will serve as the child\u2019s CAPTA guardian ad litem under section 326.5. If the court finds that the child would not benefit from the appointment of counsel, the court must appoint a CASA volunteer to serve as the child\u2019s CAPTA guardian ad litem. The court must identify on the record the person appointed as the child\u2019s CAPTA guardian ad litem.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (d) General duties and responsibilities  The general duties and responsibilities of a CAPTA guardian ad litem are:  (1) To obtain firsthand a clear understanding of the situation and needs of the child; and  (2) To make recommendations to the court concerning the best interest of the child as appropriate under (e) and (f).  (e) Attorney as guardian ad litem  The specific duties and responsibilities of the child\u2019s court-appointed attorney who is appointed to serve as the child\u2019s CAPTA guardian ad litem are stated in section 317(e) and rule 5.660.  (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (f) CASA volunteer as CAPTA guardian ad litem  The specific duties and responsibilities of the child\u2019s CASA volunteer who is appointed to serve as the child\u2019s CAPTA guardian ad litem are stated in section 102(c) and rule 5.655.

(d) Limits to responsibilities  A child\u2019s counsel is not required:  (1) To assume the responsibilities of a probation officer, social worker, parent, or guardian;  (2) To provide nonlegal services to the child; or  (3) To represent the child in any proceedings outside of the delinquency proceedings.  (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  462  Rule 5.663 amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007; adopted as rule 1479 effective July 1, 2004.  Rule 5.664.

(Subd (d) amended and relettered effective January 1, 2017; adopted as subd (d); previously relettered as subd (e) effective July 1, 1995; amended effective July 1, 2002, and January 1, 2006.)  (e) Family-finding determination (\u00a7 309)  (1) If the child is removed, the court must consider and determine whether the social worker has exercised due diligence in conducting the required investigation to identify, locate, and notify the child\u2019s relatives. The court may consider the activities listed in (f) as examples of due diligence. The court must document its determination by making a finding on the record.  If the dispositional hearing is continued, the court may set a hearing to be held 30 days from the date of removal or as soon as possible thereafter to consider and determine whether the social worker has exercised due diligence in conducting the required investigation to identify, locate, and notify the child\u2019s relatives.  (2) If the court finds that the social worker has not exercised due diligence, the court may order the social worker to exercise due diligence in conducting an investigation to identify, locate, and notify the child\u2019s relatives\u2014except for any individual the social worker identifies as inappropriate to notify under rule 5.637(b)\u2014and may require a written or oral report to the court.  488  (Subd (e) amended and relettered effective January 1, 2017; adopted as subd (f) effective January 1, 2011; previously amended effective January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2015.)

(Subd (f) amended and relettered effective January 1, 2017; adopted as subd (g) effective January 1, 2011; previously amended effective January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2015.)  (g) Provision of reunification services (\u00a7 361.5)  (1) Unless the court makes a finding that reunification services need not be provided under subdivision (b) of section 361.5 if a child is removed from the custody of a parent or legal guardian, the court must order the county welfare department to provide reunification services to the child and the child\u2019s mother and statutorily presumed parent, or the child\u2019s legal guardian, to facilitate reunification of the family as required in section 361.5.  (2) On a finding and declaration of paternity by the juvenile court or proof of a prior declaration of paternity by any court of competent jurisdiction, the juvenile court may order services for the child and the biological father, if the court determines that such services will benefit the child.  489  (3) If a child is removed from the custody of a parent or guardian, and reunification services are ordered, the court must order visitation between the child and the parent or guardian for whom services are ordered. Visits are to be as frequent as possible, consistent with the well-being of the child.  (4) Reunification services must not be provided when the parent has voluntarily relinquished the child and the relinquishment has been filed with the State Department of Social Services, or if the court has appointed a guardian under section 360.  (5) Except when the order is made under paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of section 361.5, if the court orders no reunification services for every parent otherwise eligible for such services, the court must conduct a hearing under section 366.26 within 120 days and:  (A) Order that the social worker provide a copy of the child\u2019s birth certificate to the caregiver consistent with sections 16010.4(e)(5) and 16010.5(b)\u2013(c); and  (B) Order that the social worker provide a child or youth 16 years of age or older with a certified copy of his or her birth certificate unless the court finds that provision of the birth certificate would be inappropriate.  (6) A judgment, order, or decree setting a hearing under section 366.26 is not an immediately appealable order. Review may be sought only by filing a Notice of Intent to File Writ Petition and Request for Record (California Rules of Court, Rule 8.450)  (form JV-820) or other notice of intent to file a writ petition and request for record, and a Petition for Extraordinary Writ (California Rules of Court, Rules 8.452, 8.456)  (form JV-825) or other petition for extraordinary writ. If a party wishes to preserve any right to review on appeal of the findings and orders made under this rule, the party must seek an extraordinary writ under rules 8.450 and 8.452.  (7) A judgment, order, or decree setting a hearing under section 366.26 may be reviewed on appeal following the order of the 366.26 hearing only if the following have occurred:  (A) An extraordinary writ was sought by the timely filing of a Notice of Intent to File Writ Petition and Request for Record (California Rules of Court, Rule 8.450)  (form JV-820) or other notice of intent to file a writ petition and request for record, and a Petition for Extraordinary Writ  490 (California Rules of Court, Rules 8.452, 8.456)  (form JV-825) or other petition for extraordinary writ; and  (B) The petition for extraordinary writ was summarily denied or otherwise not decided on the merits.  (8) Review on appeal of the order setting a hearing under section 366.26 is limited to issues raised in a previous petition for extraordinary writ that were supported by an adequate record.  (9) Failure to file a notice of intent to file a writ petition and request for record and a petition for extraordinary writ review within the period specified by rules 8.450 and 8.452 to substantively address the issues challenged, or to support the challenge by an adequate record, precludes subsequent review on appeal of the findings and orders made under this rule.  (10) When the court orders a hearing under section 366.26, the court must advise orally all parties present, and by first-class mail or by electronic service in accordance with section 212.5  for parties not present, that if the party wishes to preserve any right to review on appeal of the order setting the hearing under section 366.26, the party must seek an extraordinary writ by filing a Notice of Intent to File Writ Petition and Request for Record (California Rules of Court, Rule 8.450)  (form JV-820) or other notice of intent to file a writ petition and request for record and a Petition for Extraordinary Writ (California Rules of Court, Rules 8.452, 8.456)  (form JV-825) or other petition for extraordinary writ.  (A) Within 24 hours of the hearing, notice by first-class mail or by electronic service in accordance with section 212.5 must be provided by the clerk of the court to the last known address of any party who is not present when the court orders the hearing under section 366.26.  (B) Copies of Petition for Extraordinary Writ (California Rules of Court, Rules 8.452, 8.456)  (form JV-825) and Notice of Intent to File Writ Petition and Request for Record (California Rules of Court, Rule 8.450) (form JV-820) must be available in the courtroom and must accompany all mailed notices informing the parties of their rights.  (C) If the notice is for a hearing at which the social worker will recommend the termination of parental rights, the notice may be electronically served in accordance with section 212.5, but only in addition to service of the notice by first-class mail.   491 (Subd (g) amended effective January 1, 2019; adopted as subd (e); previously relettered as subd (f) effective July 1, 1995, and as subd (h) January 1, 2011; previously amended and relettered effective January 1, 2017; previously amended effective January 1, 1993, July 1, 1993, January 1, 1994, January 1, 1995, January 1, 1996, July 1, 1997, January 1, 1999, July 1, 1999, January 1, 2001, July 1, 2001, July 1, 2002, January 1, 2007, January 1, 2010, January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2015.)

Advisory Committee Comment  Family Code section 8600.5 exempts tribal customary adoption from various provisions of the Family Code applicable to adoptions generally, including section 8602, which requires the consent of a child over the age of 12 to an adoption. However, under Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.24(c)(7), \u201c[t]he child, birth parents, or Indian custodian and the tribal customary adoptive parents and their counsel, if applicable, may present evidence to the tribe regarding the tribal customary adoption and the child\u2019s best interest.\u201d Under Welfare and Institutions Code section 317(e), for all children over 4 years of age, the attorney for the child must determine the child\u2019s wishes and advise the court of the child\u2019s wishes. Welfare and Institutions Code section 361.31(e) provides that \u201c[w]here appropriate, the placement preference of the Indian child, when of sufficient age, . . . shall be considered.\u201d This is consistent with Guideline F-3 of the Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings  issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs on November 26, 1979, which recognizes that the request and wishes of a child of sufficient age are important in making an effective placement. The committee concludes, therefore, that while the consent of a child over the age of 12 is not required for a tribal customary adoption, the wishes of a child are still an important and appropriate factor for the court to consider and for children\u2019s counsel to ascertain and present to the court when determining whether tribal customary adoption is the appropriate permanent plan for an Indian child.   536 Rule 5.735.

Rule 5.770.  Conduct of transfer of jurisdiction hearing under section 707  (a) Burden of proof (\u00a7 707)  In a transfer of jurisdiction hearing under section 707, the burden of proving that there should be a transfer of jurisdiction to criminal court jurisdiction is on the petitioner, by a preponderance of the evidence.  (Subd (a) amended effective May 22, 2017; previously amended effective January 1, 1996, January 1, 2001, and July 1, 2002.)   557 (b) Criteria to consider (\u00a7 707)  Following receipt of the probation officer\u2019s report and any other relevant evidence, the court may order that the youth be transferred to the jurisdiction of the criminal court if the court finds:  (1) The youth was 16 years or older at the time of any alleged felony offense, or the youth was 14 or 15 years of age at the time of an alleged felony offense listed in section 707(b) and was not apprehended prior to the end of juvenile court jurisdiction; and  (2) The youth should be transferred to the jurisdiction of the criminal court based on an evaluation of all the criteria in section 707(a)(3) as provided in that section. The court must state on the record the basis for its decision, including how it weighed the evidence and identifying the specific factors on which the court relied to reach its decision.  Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2023; adopted as subd (b); previously amended and relettered as subd (c) effective January 1, 1996; previously amended and relettered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2007, and May 22, 2017, and January 1, 2021.)  (c) Basis for order of transfer  If the court orders a transfer of jurisdiction to the criminal court, the court must recite the basis for its decision in an order entered on the minutes.  (Subd (c) amended effective May 22, 2017; adopted as subd (c); previously amended and relettered as subd (d) effective January 1, 1996; amended and relettered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective July 1, 2002, and January 1, 2007.)  (d) Procedure following findings  (1) If the court finds the youth should be retained within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, the court must proceed to jurisdiction hearing under rule 5.774.  (2) If the court finds the youth should be transferred to the jurisdiction of the criminal court, the court must make orders under section 707.1 relating to bail and to the appropriate facility for the custody of the youth, or release on own recognizance pending prosecution. The court must set a date for the youth to appear in criminal court and dismiss the petition without prejudice upon the date of that appearance.  558  (3) When the court rules on the request to transfer the youth to the jurisdiction of the criminal court, the court must advise all parties present regarding appellate review of the order as provided in subdivision (g) of this rule. The advisement may be given orally or in writing when the court makes the ruling. The advisement must include the time for filing the notice of appeal or the petition for extraordinary writ as set forth in subdivision (g) of this rule. The court must advise the youth of the right to appeal, of the necessary steps and time for taking an appeal, of the right to the appointment of counsel if the youth is unable to retain counsel, and the right to a stay.  (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2023; adopted as subd (d); previously relettered as subd (g) effective January 1, 1996, and as subd (f) effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective July 1, 2002, and January 1, 2007; previously relettered and amended effective May 22, 2017.)  (e) Continuance or stay pending review  (1) If the prosecuting attorney informs the court orally or in writing that a review of the court\u2019s decision not to transfer jurisdiction to the criminal court will be sought and requests a continuance of the jurisdiction hearing, the court must grant a continuance for not less than two judicial days to allow time within which to obtain a stay of further proceedings from the reviewing judge or appellate court.  (2) If the youth informs the court orally or in writing that a notice of appeal of the court\u2019s decision to transfer jurisdiction to the criminal court will be filed and requests a stay, the court must issue a stay of the criminal court proceedings until a final determination of the appeal. The court retains jurisdiction to modify or lift the stay upon request of the youth.  (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2023; adopted as subd (e); previously relettered as subd (h) effective January 1, 1996, and as subd (g) effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective July 1, 2002, and January 1, 2007; previously relettered and amended effective May 22, 2017.)  (f) Subsequent role of judicial officer  Unless the youth objects, the judicial officer who has conducted a hearing on a motion to transfer jurisdiction may participate in any subsequent contested jurisdiction hearing relating to the same offense.   559 (Subd (f) amended effective January 1, 2023; adopted as subd (f); relettered as subd (i) effective January 1, 1996; previously amended and relettered as subd (h) effective January 1, 2001, and as subd (f) effective May 22, 2017.)  (g) Review of determination on a motion to transfer jurisdiction to criminal court  (1) An order granting a motion to transfer jurisdiction of a youth to the criminal court is an appealable order subject to immediate review. A notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days of the order transferring jurisdiction or 30 days after the referee\u2019s order becomes final under rule 5.540(c) or after the denial of an application for rehearing of the referee\u2019s decision to transfer jurisdiction of the youth to the criminal court. If a notice of appeal is timely filed, the court must prepare and submit the record to the Court of Appeal within 20 days.   (2) An order denying a motion to transfer jurisdiction of a youth to the criminal court is not an appealable order. Appellate review of the order is by petition for extraordinary writ. Any petition for review of a judge\u2019s order denying a motion to transfer jurisdiction of the child to the criminal court, or denying an application for rehearing of the referee\u2019s determination not to transfer jurisdiction of the child to the criminal court, must be filed no later than 20 days after the judge\u2019s order is entered, or the referee\u2019s order becomes final under rule 5.540(c).

Rule 5.770 amended effective January 1, 2023; adopted as rule 1482 effective January 1, 1991; previously amended effective January 1, 1996, January 1, 2001, July 1, 2002, May 22, 2017, and January 1, 2021; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007.   560 Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivision (b).  This subdivision reflects changes to section 707 as a result of the passage of Senate Bill 382 (Lara; Stats. 2015, ch. 234) and Proposition 57, the Public Safety and Rehabilitation Act of 2016. SB 382 was intended to clarify the factors for the juvenile court to consider when determining whether a case should be transferred to criminal court by emphasizing the unique developmental characteristics of children and their prior interactions with the juvenile justice system. Proposition 57 provided that its intent was to promote rehabilitation for juveniles and prevent them from reoffending, and to ensure that a judge makes the determination that a youth should be tried in a criminal court. Consistent with this intent, the committee urges juvenile courts\u2014when evaluating the statutory criteria to determine if transfer is appropriate\u2014to look at the totality of the circumstances, taking into account the specific statutory language guiding the court in its consideration of the criteria.  Under subdivision (b)(2), the court must state on the record the basis for its decision. The statement of decision must fully explain the court\u2019s reasoning to allow for meaningful appellate review. See, e.g., C.S. v. Superior Court  (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 1009.  Subdivision (c).  While this rule and section 707 only require the juvenile court to recite the basis for its decision when the transfer motion is granted, the advisory committee believes that juvenile courts should, as a best practice, state the basis for their decisions on these motions in all cases so that the parties have an adequate record from which to seek subsequent review.

(d) Dismissal  Absent a continuance under rule 5.776, when a jurisdiction hearing is not begun within the time limits of (a) and (b), the court must order the petition dismissed. This does not bar the filing of another petition based on the same allegations as in the original petition, but the child must not be detained.  (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (e) Waiver of hearing (\u00a7 657)  At the detention hearing, or at any time thereafter, a child may admit the allegations of the petition or plead no contest and waive further jurisdiction hearing.

Stipulation between counsel or parties and convenience of parties are not in and of themselves good cause.  (1) In order to obtain a continuance, written notice with supporting documents must be filed and served on all parties at least two court days before the date set for the hearing, unless the court finds good cause for failure to comply with these requirements. Absent a waiver of time, a child may not be detained beyond the statutory time limits.  (2) The court must state in its order the facts requiring any continuance that is granted.  (3) If the child is represented by counsel and no objection is made to an order setting or continuing the jurisdiction hearing beyond the time limits of rule 5.774, consent must be implied.

(c) Grounds for continuance\u2014discretionary (\u00a7\u00a7 700.5, 701)  The court may continue the jurisdiction hearing for no more than seven calendar days to enable the petitioner to subpoena witnesses if the child has made an extrajudicial admission and denies it, or has previously indicated to the court or petitioner an intention to admit the allegations of the petition, and at the time set for jurisdiction hearing denies the allegations.  (d) Grounds for continuance\u2014section 654.2 (\u00a7\u00a7 654.2, 654.3, 654.4)  In a case petitioned under section 602, the court may, with the consent of the child and the parent or guardian, continue the jurisdiction hearing for six months. If the court grants the continuance, the court must order the child and the parent or guardian to participate in a program of supervision under section 654, and must order the parent or guardian to participate with the child in a program of counseling or education under section 654.

(Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Rights explained (\u00a7 702.5)  After giving the advisement required by rule 5.534, the court must advise those present of each of the following rights of the child:  (1) The right to a hearing by the court on the issues raised by the petition;   564 (2) The right to assert the privilege against self-incrimination;  (3) The right to confront and to cross-examine any witness called to testify against the child; and  (4) The right to use the process of the court to compel the attendance of witnesses on the child\u2019s behalf.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (c) Admission of allegations; prerequisites to acceptance  The court must then inquire whether the child intends to admit or deny the allegations of the petition. If the child neither admits nor denies the allegations, the court must state on the record that the child does not admit the allegations. If the child wishes to admit the allegations, the court must first find and state on the record that it is satisfied that the child understands the nature of the allegations and the direct consequences of the admission, and understands and waives the rights in (b).  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (d) Consent of counsel\u2014child must admit  Counsel for the child must consent to the admission, which must be made by the child personally.

Advisory Committee Comment  This rule is intended to describe the legal process by which a person may apply to petition the juvenile court to order the sealing\u2014that is, the prohibition of access and inspection\u2014of the records related to specified cases in the custody of the juvenile court, the probation department, and other agencies and public officials. This rule establishes minimum legal standards but does not prescribe procedures for managing physical or electronic records or methods for preventing public inspection of the records at issue. These procedures remain subject to local discretion. Procedures may, but are not required to, include the actual sealing of physical records or files. Other permissible methods of sealing physical records pending their destruction under section 781(d) include, but are not limited to, storing sealed records separately from publicly accessible records, placing sealed records in a folder or sleeve of a color different from that in which publicly accessible records are kept, assigning a distinctive file number extension to sealed records, or designating them with a special stamp. Procedures for sealing electronic records must accomplish the same objectives as the procedures used to seal physical records, and appropriate access controls must be established to ensure that only authorized persons may access the sealed records.  Rule 5.840.  Dismissal of petition and sealing of records (\u00a7 786)  (a) Applicability  This rule states the procedures to dismiss and seal the records of minors who are subject to section 786.  (b) Dismissal of petition  If the court finds that a minor subject to this rule has satisfactorily completed his or her informal or formal probation supervision, the court must order the petition dismissed. The court must not dismiss a petition if it was sustained based on the commission of an offense listed in subdivision (b) of section 707 when the minor was 14 or older unless the finding on that offense has been dismissed or was reduced to a misdemeanor or an offense not listed in subdivision (b) of section 707.  621 The court may also dismiss prior petitions filed or sustained against the minor if they appear to the satisfaction of the court to meet the sealing and dismissal criteria in section 786. An unfulfilled order, condition, or restitution or an unpaid restitution fee must not be deemed to constitute unsatisfactory completion of probation supervision. The court may not extend the period of supervision or probation solely for the purpose of deferring or delaying eligibility for dismissal and sealing under section 786.  (Subd (b) amended effective September 1, 2018.)  (c) Sealing of records  For any petition dismissed by the court under section 786, including any petition dismissed before adjudication, the court must also order sealed all records in the custody of the court, law enforcement agencies, the probation department, and the Department of Justice pertaining to those dismissed petition(s) using form JV-596 , Dismissal and Sealing of Records\u2014Welfare and Institutions Code Section 786,  or a similar form. The court may also seal records pertaining to these cases in the custody of other public agencies upon a request by an individual who is eligible to have records sealed under section 786, if the court determines that sealing the additional record(s) will promote the successful reentry and rehabilitation of the individual. The prosecuting attorney, probation officer, and court must have access to these records as specifically provided in section 786. Access to the records for research purposes must be provided as required in section 787.  (Subd (c) amended effective September 1, 2018.)  (d) Destruction of records  The court must specify in its order the date by which all sealed records must be destroyed.  For court records this date may be no earlier than the date the subject of the order attains age 21 and no later than the end of the time frame set forth in section 781(d). For all other records, the date may be no earlier than the date the  subject of the order attains age 18, and no later than the time frame set forth in section 781(d) unless that time frame expires prior to the date the subject attains 18 years of age.  (e) Distribution of order  The clerk of the issuing court must send a copy of the order to each agency and official listed in the order and provide a copy of the order to the individual whose records have been sealed and his or her attorney. The court shall also provide or  622 instruct the probation department to provide the individual with form JV-596-INFO, Sealing of Records for Satisfactory Completion of Probation .

A person who receives notice from the probation department that the program has not been satisfactorily completed and that the records have not been sealed may seek review of that determination by the court by submitting a petition to the probation department on the Petition to Review Denial of Sealing of Records After Diversion Program  (form JV-598) or similar local form, and the probation  623 department must file that petition with the court for a hearing to review whether the satisfactory completion requirement has been met and the records are eligible for sealing by the probation department. The petition must be provided to the probation department within 60 days of the date the notice from the probation department was sent, and must include a copy of that notice. The probation department must file the petition with the juvenile court in the county that issued the notice within 30 days of receiving it. The clerk of the court must set the matter for hearing and notify the petitioner and the probation department of the date, time, and location of the hearing.

If the court finds after the hearing that the petitioner is eligible to have the records sealed under section 786.5, it must order the probation department to promptly comply with the sealing and notice requirements of this rule.  (Subd (c) adopted effective January 1, 2022.)  (d) Sealing of records  Upon satisfactory completion of a program of diversion or supervision subject to this rule, the probation department must seal the arrest and other records in its custody relating to the arrest or referral and participation in the program. The probation department must notify the arresting law enforcement agency to seal the records relating to the arrest and referral, and the arresting law enforcement agency must seal the records in its custody relating to the arrest, no later than 60 days from the date of the notification. Upon sealing, the law enforcement agency must notify the probation department that the records have been sealed. The probation department must also notify the public or private agency operating the diversion program to which the person has been referred to seal any records in its custody relating to the arrest or referral and participation in the program, and the operator of the program must do so no later than 60 days from the date of the notification by the probation department. Upon sealing, the public or private agency must notify the probation department that the records have been sealed.

Rule 5.850 amended effective January 1, 2022; adopted effective September 1, 2018.   Rule 5.860.  Prosecuting attorney request to access sealed juvenile case files  (a) Applicability    This rule applies when a prosecuting attorney is seeking to access, inspect, utilize, or disclose a record that has been sealed by the court under sections 781, 786, or 793, or Penal Code section 851.7, and the attorney has reason to believe that access to the record is necessary to meet the attorney\u2019s statutory or constitutional obligation to disclose favorable or exculpatory evidence to a defendant in a criminal case.  (b) Contents of the request  Any request filed with the juvenile court under this rule must include the prosecuting attorney\u2019s rationale for believing that access to the information in the record may be necessary to meet the disclosure obligation and the date by which the records are needed. The date must allow for sufficient time to meet the notice and hearing requirements of this rule. Form JV-592, Prosecutor Request for Access to Sealed Juvenile Case File, may be used for this purpose.  (c) Notice and opportunity to respond   (1) Notice requirements   (A) The request must include a form for the court to notify the person whose records are to be accessed as well as that person\u2019s attorney of record, and a form for those individuals to respond in writing and to request an appearance before the juvenile court.

(2) Requirements if a response is filed    625 (A) If a written response is filed no more than 10 days after the date the notice was issued and no appearance has been requested, the clerk of the court must provide that response to the juvenile court for its consideration as it reviews the prosecuting attorney\u2019s request.  (B) If a response is filed no more than 10 days after the date the notice was issued and an appearance is requested, the clerk of the court must set a hearing and provide notice of the hearing to the person with the sealed record, the attorney of record for that person, and the prosecuting attorney who filed the request.   (d) Juvenile court review and order  The court must review the case file and records that have been referenced by the prosecuting attorney\u2019s request as well as any response provided as set forth in subdivision (c)(2). The court must approve the request, in whole or in part, if it determines that access to a specific sealed record or portion of a sealed record is necessary to enable the prosecuting attorney to comply with the disclosure obligation. If the court approves the request, the order must include appropriate limits on the access, inspection, utilization, and disclosure of the sealed record information in order to protect the confidentiality of the person whose sealed record is at issue. Such limits may include protective orders to accompany authorized disclosure, discovery, or access, including an order that the prosecuting attorney first submit the records to be disclosed to the court for its review and possible redaction to protect confidentiality. The court must make its initial order within 21 court days of when the request is filed, unless an appearance has been requested under subdivision (c)(2), in which case the court must act within five court days of the date set for the appearance.
