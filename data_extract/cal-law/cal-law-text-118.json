{"prompt": "based on the pleadings, the court must mail a copy of form DV-179 to the person who filed form DV-176 and the person who made the request to keep the minor\u2019s information confidential. Parties may be served in court if present at the hearing.  (iii) If the court finds that the request to release confidential information is insufficiently specific to meet the requirements under Family Code section 6301.5(d)(3), the court may conduct a  170 closed hearing to determine if there are additional facts that would support granting the request. The court may receive any relevant evidence, including testimony from the person requesting release of the minor\u2019s confidential information, the minor, the legal guardian, the person who requested the restraining order, or other competent witness.  (Subd (h) amended effective September 1, 2020.)  (i) Protecting information in subsequent filings and other civil cases  (1) Filings made after an order granting confidentiality  (A) A party seeking to file a document or form after an order for confidentiality has been made must submit the  Cover Sheet for Confidential Information  (form DV-175) attached to the front of the document to be filed.  (B) Upon receipt of form DV-175 with attached documents, the court must:  (i) Order a procedure for redaction consistent with the procedures stated in (f);  (ii) File the unredacted document in the confidential file pending receipt of the redacted document if the redacted document is not prepared on the same court day; and  (iii) File the redacted document in the public file after it has been reviewed and approved by the court for accuracy.  (2) Other civil case  (A) Information subject to an order of confidentiality issued under Family Code section 6301.5 must be kept confidential in any family law case and any other civil case with the same parties.  (B) The minor or person making the request for confidentiality and any person who has been served with a notice of confidentiality must submit a copy of the order of confidentiality (form DV-165) in any family law case and any other civil case with the same parties.  (Subd (i) amended effective September 1, 2020.)   171 Rule 5.382 amended effective September 1, 2020; adopted effective January 1, 2019.  Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivisions (a), (b), (d), and (e). The process described in this rule need not be used if the request for confidentiality is merely to keep an address confidential and the minor has a mailing address which does not need to be kept private that can be listed on the forms, or if the minor\u2019s address can be made confidential under Family Code section 3429. In addition, the address need not be listed on the protective order for enforcement purposes under Family Code section 6225. The restraining order forms do not require the address of the nonpetitioning minor.  This rule and rule 2.551 provide a standard and procedures for courts to follow when a request is made to seal a record. The standard as reflected in Family Code section 6301.5 is based on NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178. The standard recognizes the First Amendment right of access to documents used at trial or as a basis of adjudication.   Article 2.

(b) Process for registration of order  The written procedure or local rule developed in consultation with the local tribal court or courts must provide a process for:  (1) The tribal court or courts to contact a representative of the superior court to inform him or her that a request for registration of a tribal court protective order will be made;  (2) Confirmation of receipt of the request for registration of the order; and   172 (3) Return of copies of the registered order to the tribal court or the protected person.

Neither the cover sheet nor the special handling instructions are to be filed in the case. The court is not required to keep a copy of the cover sheet.  Rule 5.386 adopted effective July 1, 2012.

Rule 5.390.  Bifurcation of issues  Rule 5.390.  Bifurcation of issues  (a) Request for order to bifurcate  As part of the noticed Request for Order  (FL-300) of a party, the stipulation of the parties, case management, or the court\u2019s own motion, the court may bifurcate one or more issues to be tried separately before other issues are tried. A party requesting a separate trial or responding to a request for a separate trial must complete Application or Response to Application for Separate Trial  (form FL-315).   173 (b) When to bifurcate  The court may separately try one or more issues before trial of the other issues if resolution of the bifurcated issue is likely to simplify the determination of the other issues. Issues that may be appropriate to try separately in advance include:  (1) Validity of a postnuptial or premarital agreement;  (2) Date of separation;  (3) Date to use for valuation of assets;  (4) Whether property is separate or community;  (5) How to apportion increase in value of a business;  (6) Existence or value of business or professional goodwill;  (7) Termination of status of a marriage or domestic partnership;  (8) Child custody and visitation (parenting time);  (9) Child, spousal, or domestic partner support;  (10) Attorney\u2019s fees and costs;  (11) Division of property and debts;  (12) Reimbursement claims; or  (13) Other issues specific to a family law case.  (c) Alternate date of valuation  Requests for separate trial regarding alternate date of valuation under Family Code section 2552(b) must be accompanied by a declaration stating the following:  (1) The proposed alternate valuation date;  (2)  Whether the proposed alternate valuation date applies to all or only a portion of the assets and, if the Request for Order  (FL-300) is directed to only a portion of the assets, the declaration must separately identify each such asset; and  174  (3)  The reasons supporting the alternate valuation date.  (d) Separate trial to terminate status of marriage or domestic partnership  (1) All pension plans that have not been divided by court order that require joinder must be joined as a party to the case before a petitioner or respondent may file a request for a separate trial to terminate marital status or the domestic partnership. Parties may refer to Retirement Plan Joinder\u2014Information Sheet  (form FL-318-INFO) to help determine whether their retirement benefit plans must be joined.  (2) The party not requesting termination of status may ask the court:  (A) To order that the judgment granting a dissolution include conditions that preserve his or her claims in retirement benefit plans, health insurance, and other assets; and  (B) For other orders made as conditions to terminating the parties\u2019 marital status or domestic partnership.  (3) The court must use Bifurcation of Status of Marriage or Domestic Partnership\u2014Attachment  (form FL-347) as an attachment to the order after hearing in these matters.  (4) In cases involving division of pension benefits acquired by the parties during the marriage or domestic partnership, the court must use Pension Benefits\u2014Attachment to Judgment  (form FL-348) to set out the orders upon severance of the status of marriage or domestic partnership. The form serves as a temporary qualified domestic relations order and must be attached to the status-only judgment and then served on the plan administrator. It can also be attached to a judgment to allow the parties time to prepare a qualified domestic relations order.  (e) Notice by clerk  Within 10 days after the order deciding the bifurcated issue and any statement of decision under rule 3.1591 have been filed, the clerk must serve copies to the parties and file a certificate of mailing or a certificate of electronic service.

(b) Certificate of probable cause for appeal  (1) The order deciding the bifurcated issue may include an order certifying that there is probable cause for immediate appellate review of the issue.

The motion must be heard within 30 days after the order deciding the bifurcated issue is served.  (3) The clerk must promptly serve notice of the decision on the motion to the parties.
