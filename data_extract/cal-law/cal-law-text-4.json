The council may, however, assign policy-implementation and programmatic responsibilities to an advisory body and may request it make recommendations to the Administrative Director on implementation of council policy or programs;  (4) Do not speak or act for the council except when formally given such authority for specific and time-limited purposes; and  (5) Are responsible, through Judicial Council staff, for gathering stakeholder perspectives on policy recommendations they plan to present to the council.

Except for the Court Executives Advisory Committee, when a member\u2019s term as the chair of an advisory committee ends, that member\u2019s term on the committee also ends, unless the Chief Justice orders otherwise.
