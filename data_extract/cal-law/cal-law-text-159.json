{"prompt": " (E) The Indian child\u2019s tribe, if applicable, as defined in rule 5.502;  (F) The child\u2014if 10 years of age or older\u2014or nonminor; and  (G) All other persons entitled to notice under section 293 or section 727.4(a).  (3) If the court grants a hearing under (c)(1), responsibility for providing specialty mental health services cannot be transferred until the court makes a ruling as required in (e)(2) and section 14717.1(d)(4).  (d) Reports  When a hearing is granted under (c)(1), the social worker or probation officer must provide a report including discussion or documentation of the following:   412 (1) The placing agency\u2019s rationale for its decision on the request for a waiver of presumptive transfer, including:  (A) Any requests for waiver, and the exceptions claimed as the basis for those requests;  (B) The placing agency\u2019s determination of whether waiver of presumptive transfer is appropriate under section 14717.1(d)(5)(A)\u2013(D);  (C) Any objections to the placing agency\u2019s determination in (B); and  (D) The ways that the child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s best interests will be promoted by the placing agency\u2019s presumptive transfer determination.  (2) That the child or nonminor, his or her parents if applicable, the child and family team, and others who serve the child or nonminor as appropriate\u2014such as the therapist, mental health care decision maker for the child or nonminor if one has been appointed under section 361(a)(1), and Court Appointed Special Advocate volunteer\u2014were consulted regarding the waiver determination.  (3) That notice of the placing agency\u2019s determination of whether to waive presumptive transfer was provided to the individual who requested waiver of presumptive transfer, along with all parties to the case.  (4) Whether the mental health plan in the county of original jurisdiction demonstrates an existing contract with a specialty mental health care provider, or the ability to enter into a contract with a specialty mental health care provider within 30 days of the waiver decision, and the ability to deliver timely specialty mental health services directly to the foster child or nonminor.  (5) The child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s current provision of specialty mental health services, and how those services will be affected by the placing agency\u2019s presumptive transfer determination.  (e) Conduct at the hearing  (1) The social worker or probation officer must provide the report in (d) to the court, all parties to the case, and the person or agency that requested the waiver no later than two court days after the hearing is set under (c)(1).   413 (2) At the hearing, the court may confirm or deny the transfer of jurisdiction or application of an exception based on the best interests of the child or nonminor. A waiver of presumptive transfer is contingent on the mental health plan in the county of original jurisdiction demonstrating an existing contract with a specialty mental health care provider, or the ability to enter into such a contract within 30 days of the waiver decision, and the ability to deliver timely specialty mental health services directly to the child or nonminor.  (3) The person or agency that requested the waiver of presumptive transfer bears the burden to show that an exception to presumptive transfer is in the best interests of the child or nonminor by a preponderance of the evidence.  (4) The hearing must conclude within five court days of the initial hearing date, unless a showing of good cause consistent with section 352 or section 682 supports a continuance of the hearing beyond five days.  (5) When considering whether it is in the child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s best interests to confirm or deny the request for a waiver of presumptive transfer, the court may consider the following in addition to any other factors the court deems relevant:  (A) The child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s access to specialty mental health services, the current provision of specialty mental health services to the child or nonminor, and whether any important service relationships will be affected by the transfer of jurisdiction or a waiver of presumptive transfer;  (B) If reunification services are being provided, the impact that the transfer of jurisdiction would have on reunification services;  (C) The anticipated length of stay in the child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s new placement;  (D) The position of the child or nonminor, or of the child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s attorney, on presumptive transfer; and  (E) The ability to maintain specialty mental health services in the county of original jurisdiction or to arrange for specialty mental health services in the county of residence after the child or nonminor changes placements.  (6) Findings and orders must be made on Order after Hearing on Waiver of Presumptive Transfer  (form JV-215).  414  (f) Existing out-of-county placement  This rule applies to presumptive transfer for any child or nonminor who resided in a county other than the county of original jurisdiction after June 30, 2017, and who continues to reside outside his or her county of original jurisdiction after December 31, 2017, and has not had a presumptive transfer determination as required under Welfare and Institutions Code section 14717.1(c)(2). Unless amended by Judicial Council action effective after the effective date of this rule, this subdivision will be repealed effective January 1, 2020.  Rule 5.647 adopted effective September 1, 2018.  Advisory Committee Comment  The exceptions to the presumptive transfer of the responsibility to provide for and arrange for specialty mental health services to the county of the child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s out-of-county residence are found in Welfare and Institutions Code section 14717.1(d)(5)(A\u2013D). A court review hearing under this rule may not necessarily be common, but under section 14717.1(d)(7), for all cases, a request for waiver, the exceptions claimed as the basis for the request, a determination whether a waiver is appropriate under Welfare and Institutions Code section 14717.1, and any objections to the determination must be documented in the child\u2019s or nonminor\u2019s case plan under Welfare and Institutions Code section 16501.1. The Department of Health Care Services and California Department of Social Services are responsible for providing policy guidance and regulations to implement Assembly Bill 1299 (Ridley-Thomas; Stats. 2016, ch. 603). The policy guidance and regulations should be used during the administrative process related to presumptive transfer. This would include determining who is entitled to make a request for waiver under (b)(1)(D) of the rule and section 14717.1(d)(2), where \u201cdepartment\u201d refers to the Department of Health Care Services. In the policy guidance and regulations, the Department of Health Care Services and California Department of Social Services will determine who owes a legal duty to the child or nonminor and thus may request a waiver of presumptive transfer. In addition, the policy guidance and regulations will address the timelines for the period to request a hearing. Presumptive transfer cannot occur until the court has made a ruling on the request for a hearing, and if a hearing is granted, makes a ruling as required in (c)(3). In accordance with the policy guidance issued by the Department of Health Care Services and California Department of Social Services, the delivery of existing specialty mental health services to the child or nonminor must however continue without interruption, and be provided or arranged for, and paid for by the Mental Health Plan in the county of original jurisdiction until the court makes a ruling on the request for a hearing or makes a ruling as required in (c)(3) if a hearing is granted.  415   Rule 5.649.  Right to make educational or developmental-services decisions  The court must identify the educational rights holder for the child at each hearing in a juvenile dependency or juvenile justice proceeding. At any hearing, where the court limits, restores, or modifies educational rights, or where there are updates to any contact or other information, in any juvenile proceeding, the findings and orders must be documented on form JV-535. Unless the rights of the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian have been limited by the court under this rule, the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian holds the educational and developmental-services decisionmaking rights for the child. In addition, a nonminor or nonminor dependent youth holds the rights to mae educational and developmental-services decisions for the youth and should be identified on form JV-535, unless rule 5.650(b) applies.   (a) Order (\u00a7\u00a7 361, 366, 366.27, 366.3, 726, 727.2; 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415; 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.300)  At the dispositional hearing and each subsequent review or permanency hearing, the court must determine whether the rights of a parent, guardian, or Indian custodian to make educational or developmental-services decisions for the child should be limited.  If necessary to protect a child who is adjudged a dependent or ward of the court under section 300, 601, or 602, the court may limit the rights of a parent,  guardian, or Indian custodian to make educational or developmental-services decisions for the child by making appropriate, specific orders on Order Designating Educational Rights Holder (form JV-535).  (Subd (a) amended effective September 1, 2020.)  (b) Temporary order (\u00a7 319)  At the initial hearing on a petition filed under section 325 or at any time before a child is adjudged a dependent or the petition is dismissed, the court may, on making the findings required by section 319(g)(1), use form JV-535 to temporarily limit the rights of a parent, guardian, or Indian custodian to make educational or developmental-services decisions for the child. An order made under section 319(g) expires on dismissal of the petition, but in no circumstances later than the conclusion of the hearing held under section 361.  If the court does temporarily limit the rights of a parent, guardian, or Indian custodian to make educational or developmental-services decisions, the court must,  416 at the dispositional hearing, reconsider the need to limit those rights and must identify the authorized educational rights holder on form JV-535.  (Subd (b) amended effective September 1, 2020.)  (c) No delay of initial assessment  The child\u2019s initial assessment to determine any need for special education or developmental services need not be delayed to obtain parental or guardian consent or for the appointment of an educational rights holder if one or more of the following circumstances is met:  (1) The court has limited, even temporarily, the educational or developmental-services decisionmaking rights of the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian, and consent for an initial assessment has been given by an individual appointed by the court to represent the child;  (2) The local educational agency or regional center, after reasonable efforts, cannot locate the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian; or  (3) Parental rights have been terminated or the guardianship has been set aside.  (Subd (c) amended effective September 1, 2020.)  (d) Judicial Determination  If the court determines that the child is in need of any assessments, evaluations, or services\u2014including special education, mental health, developmental, and other related services\u2014the court must direct an appropriate person to take the necessary steps to request those assessments, evaluations, or services.  (e) Filing of order  Following the dispositional hearing and each statutory review hearing, the party that has requested a modification, limitation, or restoration of educational or developmental-services decisionmaking rights must complete form JV-535 and any required attachments to reflect the court\u2019s orders and submit the completed form \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
