(Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted effective January 1, 1991; previously amended effective January 1, 2007, and May 23, 2007.)  Rule 4.421 amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted as rule 421 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 1991, January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, and January 1, 2017.  Advisory Committee Comment  Courts may not impose a sentence greater than the middle term except when aggravating factors justifying the imposition of the upper term have been stipulated to by the defendant or found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by the jury or the judge in a court trial. These requirements do not apply to consideration of aggravating factors for the lower or middle term. If the court finds that any of the factors listed in section 1170(b)(6)(A\u2013C) were a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the court must impose the lower term (see rule 4.420(e)) unless the court finds that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors to such a degree that  78 imposing the lower term would be contrary to the interests of justice. In this instance, since the court is not addressing the imposition of the upper term, the court may consider factors in aggravation that have not been stipulated to by the defendant or found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by the jury or the judge in a court trial.  In determining whether to impose the upper term for a criminal offense, the court may consider as an aggravating factor that a defendant has suffered one or more prior convictions, based on a certified record of conviction. This exception may not be used to select the upper term of an enhancement.   This rule does not deal with the dual use of the facts; the statutory prohibition against dual use is included, in part, in the comment to rule 4.420.  Refusal to consider the personal characteristics of the defendant in imposing sentence may raise serious constitutional questions. The California Supreme Court has held that sentencing decisions must take into account \u201cthe nature of the offense and/or the offender, with particular regard to the degree of danger both present to society.\u201d (In re Rodriguez (1975) 14 Cal.3d 639, 654, quoting In  re Lynch (1972) 8 Cal.3d 410, 425.) In  Rodriguez the court released petitioner from further incarceration because \u201cit appears that neither the circumstances of his offense nor his personal characteristics establish a danger to society sufficient to justify such a prolonged period of imprisonment.\u201d ( Id. at p. 655, fn. omitted, italics added.) \u201cFor the determination of sentences, justice generally requires . . . that there be taken into account the circumstances of the offense together with the character and propensities of the offender.\u201d ( Pennsylvania ex rel. Sullivan v. Ashe (1937) 302 U.S. 51, 55, quoted with approval in Gregg v. Georgia (1976) 428 U.S. 153, 189.)  Other statutory factors in aggravation are listed, for example, in sections 422.76, 1170.7, 1170.71, 1170.8, and 1170.85, and may be considered to impose the upper term if stipulated to by the defendant or found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by a jury or the judge in a court trial.  Rule 4.423.  Circumstances in mitigation  Circumstances in mitigation include factors relating to the crime and factors relating to the defendant.  (a) Factors relating to the crime  Factors relating to the crime include that:  (1) The defendant was a passive participant or played a minor role in the crime;  (2) The victim was an initiator of, willing participant in, or aggressor or provoker of the incident;  (3) The crime was committed because of an unusual circumstance, such as great provocation, that is unlikely to recur;  (4) The defendant participated in the crime under circumstances of coercion or duress, or the criminal conduct was partially excusable for some other reason not amounting to a defense;  79  (5) The defendant, with no apparent predisposition to do so, was induced by others to participate in the crime;  (6) The defendant exercised caution to avoid harm to persons or damage to property, or the amounts of money or property taken were deliberately small, or no harm was done or threatened against the victim;  (7) The defendant believed that he or she had a claim or right to the property taken, or for other reasons mistakenly believed that the conduct was legal;  (8) The defendant was motivated by a desire to provide necessities for his or her family or self; and  (9) The defendant suffered from repeated or continuous physical, sexual, or psychological abuse inflicted by the victim of the crime, and the victim of the crime, who inflicted the abuse, was the defendant\u2019s spouse, intimate cohabitant, or parent of the defendant\u2019s child; and the abuse does not amount to a defense.  (10) If a firearm was used in the commission of the offense, it was unloaded or inoperable.   (Subd (a) amended effective March 14, 2022; previously amended effective January 1, 1991, July 1, 1993, January 1, 2007, and May 23, 2007.)  (b) Factors relating to the defendant  Factors relating to the defendant include that:  (1) The defendant has no prior record, or has an insignificant record of criminal conduct, considering the recency and frequency of prior crimes;  (2) The defendant was suffering from a mental or physical condition that significantly reduced culpability for the crime;  (3) The defendant experienced psychological, physical, or childhood trauma, including, but not limited to, abuse, neglect, exploitation, or sexual violence and it was a factor in the commission of the crime;  (4) The commission of the current offense is connected to the defendant\u2019s prior victimization or childhood trauma, or mental illness as defined by section 1385(c);   80 (5) The defendant is or was a victim of intimate partner violence or human trafficking at the time of the commission of the offense, and it was a factor in the commission of the offense;  (6) The defendant is under 26 years of age, or was under 26 years of age at the time of the commission of the offense;  (7) The defendant was a juvenile when they committed the current offense;  (8) The defendant voluntarily acknowledged wrongdoing before arrest or at an early stage of the criminal process;  (9) The defendant is ineligible for probation and but for that ineligibility would have been granted probation;  (10) Application of an enhancement could result in a sentence over 20 years;  (11) Multiple enhancements are alleged in a single case;  (12) Application of an enhancement could result in a discriminatory racial impact;  (13) An enhancement is based on a prior conviction that is over five years old;  (14) The defendant made restitution to the victim; and  (15) The defendant\u2019s prior performance on probation, mandatory supervision, postrelease community supervision, or parole was satisfactory.

(c) Other factors  Any other factors statutorily declared to be circumstances in mitigation or that reasonably relate to the defendant or the circumstances under which the crime was committed.  (Subd (c) adopted effective January 1, 2018.)  Rule 4.423 amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted as rule 423 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 1991, July 1, 1993, January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, January 1, 2017, and January 1, 2018.  Advisory Committee Comment   See comment to rule 4.421.   81 This rule applies both to mitigation for purposes of section 1170(b) and to circumstances in mitigation justifying the court in striking the additional punishment provided for an enhancement.  Some listed circumstances can never apply to certain enhancements; for example, \u201cthe amounts taken were deliberately small\u201d can never apply to an excessive taking under section 12022.6, and \u201cno harm was done\u201d can never apply to infliction of great bodily injury under section 12022.7. In any case, only the facts present may be considered for their possible effect in mitigation.  See also rule 4.409; only relevant criteria need be considered.  Since only the fact of restitution is considered relevant to mitigation, no reference to the defendant\u2019s financial ability is needed. The omission of a comparable factor from rule 4.421 as a circumstance in aggravation is deliberate.  Rule 4.424.  Consideration of applicability of section 654  Before determining whether to impose either concurrent or consecutive sentences on all counts on which the defendant was convicted, the court must determine whether the proscription in section 654 against multiple punishments for the same act or omission requires a stay of execution of the sentence imposed on some of the counts. If a stay of execution is required due to the prohibition against multiple punishments for the same act, the court has discretion to choose which act or omission will be punished and which will be stayed.

Rule 4.425. Factors affecting concurrent or consecutive sentences  Factors affecting the decision to impose consecutive rather than concurrent sentences include:  (a) Facts relating to crimes  Facts relating to the crimes, including whether or not:  (1) The crimes and their objectives were predominantly independent of each other;  (2) The crimes involved separate acts of violence or threats of violence; or  (3) The crimes were committed at different times or separate places, rather than being committed so closely in time and place as to indicate a single period of aberrant behavior.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective January 1, 1991, and January 1, 2007.)  82  (b) Other facts and limitations  Any circumstances in aggravation or mitigation, whether or not the factors have been stipulated to by the defendant or found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by a jury or the judge in a court trial, may be considered in deciding whether to impose consecutive rather than concurrent sentences, except:  (1) A fact used to impose the upper term;  (2) A fact used to otherwise enhance the defendant\u2019s sentence in prison or county jail under section 1170(h); and  (3) A fact that is an element of the crime.   Subd (b) amended effective March 14, 2022; previously amended effective January 1, 1991, January 1, 2007, January 1, 2017, and January 1, 2018.)

Advisory Committee Comment  The sentencing judge should be aware that there are some cases in which the law mandates consecutive sentences.   Rule 4.426.
