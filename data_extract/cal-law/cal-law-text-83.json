{"prompt": "should not consider whether the defendant has simply pled guilty, factors related to controlling the court\u2019s calendar, or antipathy toward the statutory scheme. (See People v. Romero  (1996) 13 Cal.4th 947; People v. Dent  (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1726; People v. Kessel  (1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 322; People v. Orin  (1975) 13 Cal.3d 937.)   88 How to afford great weight to a mitigating circumstance is not further explained in section 1385. The court is not directed to give conclusive weight to the mitigating factors, and must still engage in a weighing of both mitigating and aggravating factors. A review of case law suggests that the court can find great weight when there is an absence of \u201csubstantial evidence of countervailing considerations of sufficient weight to overcome\u201d the presumption of dismissal when the mitigating factors are present. ( People v. Martin  (1996) 42 Cal.3d 437.) In exercising this discretion, the court may rely on aggravating factors that have not been stipulated to by the defendant or proven beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by a jury or a judge in a court trial. (People v. Black  (2007) 41 Cal.4th 799.)   Rule 4.431.  Proceedings at sentencing to be reported  All proceedings at the time of sentencing must be reported.  Rule 4.431 amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as rule 431 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001.  Advisory Committee Comment  Reporters\u2019 transcripts of the sentencing proceedings are required on appeal (rule 8.320, except in certain cases under subdivision (d) of that rule), and when the defendant is sentenced to prison (section 1203.01).  Rule 4.433.  Matters to be considered at time set for sentencing  (a) In every case, at the time set for sentencing under section 1191, the sentencing judge must hold a hearing at which the judge must:  (1) Hear and determine any matters raised by the defendant under section 1201;  (2) Determine whether a defendant who is eligible for probation should be granted or denied probation, unless consideration of probation is expressly waived by the defendant personally and by counsel; and  (3) Determine whether to deny a period of mandatory supervision in the interests of justice under section 1170(h)(5)(A).  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2017; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) If the imposition of a sentence is to be suspended during a period of probation after a conviction by trial, the trial judge must identify and state circumstances that would justify imposition of one of the three authorized terms of imprisonment referred to in section 1170(b), or any enhancement, if probation is later revoked. The circumstances identified and stated by the judge must be based on evidence admitted at the trial or other circumstances properly considered under rule 4.420(b).   89 (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective July 28, 1977, January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, January 1, 2008, and January 1, 2017.)  (c) If a sentence of imprisonment is to be imposed, or if the execution of a sentence of imprisonment is to be suspended during a period of probation, the sentencing judge must:  (1) Determine, under section 1170(b), whether to impose one of the three authorized terms of imprisonment referred to in section 1170(b), or any enhancement, and state on the record the reasons for imposing that term;  (2) Determine whether any additional term of imprisonment provided for an enhancement charged and found will be stricken;  (3) Determine whether the sentences will be consecutive or concurrent if the defendant has been convicted of multiple crimes;  (4) Determine any issues raised by statutory prohibitions on the dual use of facts and statutory limitations on enhancements, as required in rules 4.420(c) and 4.447; and  (5) Pronounce the court\u2019s judgment and sentence, stating the terms thereof and giving reasons for those matters for which reasons are required by law.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective July 28, 1977, July 1, 2003, January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, and January 1, 2017.)  (d) All these matters must be heard and determined at a single hearing unless the sentencing judge otherwise orders in the interests of justice.   (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (e) When a sentence of imprisonment is imposed under (c) or under rule 4.435, the sentencing judge must inform the defendant:  (1) Under section 1170(c) of the parole period provided by section 3000 to be served after expiration of the sentence, in addition to any period of incarceration for parole violation;  (2) Of the period of postrelease community supervision provided by section 3456 to be served after expiration of the sentence, in addition to any period of incarceration for a violation of postrelease community supervision; or   (3) Of any period of mandatory supervision imposed under section 1170(h)(5)(A) and (B), in addition to any period of imprisonment for a violation of mandatory supervision.   90 (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective July 28, 1977, January 1, 1979, July 1, 2003, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2017.)  Rule 4.433 amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted as rule 433 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective July 28, 1977, January 1, 1979, July 1, 2003, January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, January 1, 2008, and January 1, 2017.  Advisory Committee Comment  This rule summarizes the questions that the court is required to consider at the time of sentencing, in their logical order.  Subdivision (a)(2) makes it clear that probation should be considered in every case, without the necessity of any application, unless the defendant is statutorily ineligible for probation.  Under subdivision (b), when imposition of sentence is to be suspended, the sentencing judge is not to make any determinations as to possible length of a term of imprisonment on violation of probation (section 1170(b)). If there was a trial, however, the judge must state on the record the circumstances that would justify imposition of one of the three authorized terms of imprisonment based on the trial evidence.  Subdivision (d) makes it clear that all sentencing matters should be disposed of at a single hearing unless strong reasons exist for a continuance.  Rule 4.435. Sentencing on revocation of probation, mandatory supervision, and postrelease community supervision  (a) When the defendant violates the terms of probation, mandatory supervision, or postrelease community supervision or is otherwise subject to revocation of supervision, the sentencing judge may make any disposition of the case authorized by statute. In deciding whether to permanently revoke supervision, the judge may consider the nature of the violation and the defendant\u2019s past performance on supervision.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective January 1, 1991.)  (b) On revocation and termination of supervision under section 1203.2, when the sentencing judge determines that the defendant will be committed to prison or county jail under section 1170(h):  (1) If the imposition of sentence was previously suspended, the judge must impose judgment and sentence after considering any findings previously made and hearing and determining the matters enumerated in rule 4.433(c). The length of the sentence must be based on circumstances existing at the time supervision was granted, and subsequent events may not be considered  91 in selecting the base term or in deciding whether to strike the additional punishment for enhancements charged and found.  (2) If the execution of sentence was previously suspended, the judge must order that the judgment previously pronounced be in full force and effect and that the defendant be committed to the custody of the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or local county correctional administrator or sheriff for the term prescribed in that judgment.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective July 1, 2003, January 1, 2006, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2017.)  Rule 4.435 amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted as rule 435 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 1991, July 1, 2003, January 1, 2006, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2017.  Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivision (a) makes it clear that there is no change in the court\u2019s power, on finding cause to revoke and terminate supervision under section 1203.2(a), to continue the defendant on supervision.  The restriction of subdivision (b)(1) is based on In re Rodriguez (1975) 14 Cal.3d 639, 652: \u201c[T]he primary term must reflect the circumstances existing at the time of the offense.\u201d  A judge imposing imprisonment on revocation of probation will have the power granted by section 1170(d) to recall the commitment on his or her own motion within 120 days after the date of commitment, and the power under section 1203.2(e) to set aside the revocation of probation, for good cause, within 30 days after the court has notice that execution of the sentence has commenced.  Consideration of conduct occurring after the granting of probation should be distinguished from consideration of preprobation conduct that is discovered after the granting of an order of probation and before sentencing following a revocation and termination of probation. If the preprobation conduct affects or nullifies a determination made at the time probation was granted, the preprobation conduct may properly be considered at sentencing following revocation and termination of probation. (See People v. Griffith (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 796, 801.) While People v. Griffith  refers only to probation, this rule likely will apply to any form of supervision.   Rule 4.437.  Statements in aggravation and mitigation  (a) Time for filing and service  Statements in aggravation and mitigation referred to in section 1170(b) must be filed and served at least four days before the time set for sentencing under section 1191 or the time set for pronouncing judgment on revocation of probation under section 1203.2(c) if imposition of sentence was previously suspended.   92 (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Combined statement  A party seeking consideration of circumstances in aggravation or mitigation may file and serve a statement under section 1170(b) and this rule.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (c) Contents of statement  A statement in aggravation or mitigation must include:  (1) A summary of evidence that the party relies on as circumstances justifying the imposition of a particular term; and  (2) Notice of intention to dispute facts or offer evidence in aggravation or mitigation at the sentencing hearing. The statement must generally describe the evidence to be offered, including a description of any documents and the names and expected substance of the testimony of any witnesses. No evidence in aggravation or mitigation may be introduced at the sentencing hearing unless it was described in the statement, or unless its admission is permitted by the sentencing judge in the interests of justice.  (Subd (c) amended effective May 23, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (d) Support required for assertions of fact  Assertions of fact in a statement in aggravation or mitigation must be disregarded unless they are supported by the record in the case, the probation officer\u2019s report or \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
