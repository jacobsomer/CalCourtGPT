(d) Examination of defendant after initiation of mental competency proceedings  (1) On initiation of mental competency proceedings, the court must inquire whether the defendant, or defendant\u2019s counsel, seeks a finding of mental incompetence.  (2)  Any court-appointed experts must examine the defendant and advise the court on the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial. Experts\u2019 reports are to be submitted to the court, counsel for the defendant, and the prosecution. The report must include the following:  (A) A brief statement of the examiner\u2019s training and previous experience as it relates to examining the competence of a criminal defendant to stand trial and preparing a resulting report;  (B) A summary of the examination conducted by the examiner on the defendant, including a summary of the defendant\u2019s mental status, a diagnosis under the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , if possible, of the defendant\u2019s current mental health disorder or disorders, and a statement as to whether symptoms of the mental health disorder or disorders which motivated the defendant\u2019s behavior would respond to mental health treatment;  (C) A detailed analysis of the competence of the defendant to stand trial using California\u2019s current legal standard, including the defendant\u2019s ability or inability to understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or assist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a rational manner as a result of a mental health disorder;  (D) A summary of an assessment\u2014conducted for malingering or feigning symptoms, if clinically indicated\u2014which may include, but need not be limited to, psychological testing;  (E) Under Penal Code section 1369, a statement on whether treatment with antipsychotic or other medication is medically appropriate for the defendant, whether the treatment is likely to restore the defendant to mental competence, a list of likely or potential side effects of the medication, the expected efficacy of the medication, possible  27 alternative treatments, whether it is medically appropriate to administer antipsychotic or other medication in the county jail, and whether the defendant has capacity to make decisions regarding antipsychotic or other medication. If an examining psychologist is of the opinion that a referral to a psychiatrist is necessary to address these issues, the psychologist must inform the court of this opinion and his or her recommendation that a psychiatrist should examine the defendant;  (F) A list of all sources of information considered by the examiner, including legal, medical, school, military, regional center, employment, hospital, and psychiatric records; the evaluations of other experts; the results of psychological testing; police reports; criminal history; statement of the defendant; statements of any witnesses to the alleged crime; booking information, mental health screenings, and mental health records following the alleged crime; consultation with the prosecutor and defendant\u2019s attorney; and any other collateral sources considered in reaching his or her conclusion;  (G) If the defendant is charged with a felony offense, a recommendation, if possible, for a placement or type of placement or treatment program that is most appropriate for restoring the defendant to competency; and  (H) If the defendant is charged only with a misdemeanor offense, an opinion based on present clinical impressions and available historical data as to whether the defendant, regardless of custody status, appears to be gravely disabled, as defined in Welfare and Institutions Code section 5008(h)(1)(A).

(Subd (d) amended effective May 13, 2022; previously amended effective January 1, 2018, January 1, 2020, and September 1, 2020.)  (e) Trial on mental competency  (1) Regardless of the conclusions or findings of the court-appointed expert, the court must conduct a trial on the mental competency of the defendant if the court has initiated mental competency proceedings under (b).  (2) At the trial, the defendant is presumed to be mentally competent, and it is the burden of the party contending that the defendant is not mentally competent to prove the defendant\u2019s mental incompetence by a preponderance of the evidence.   28 (3) In addition to the testimony of the experts appointed by the court under (d), either party may call additional experts or other relevant witnesses.  (4) After the presentation of the evidence and closing argument, the trier of fact is to determine whether the defendant is mentally competent or mentally incompetent.    (A) If the matter is tried by a jury, the verdict must be unanimous.  (B) If the parties have waived the right to a jury trial, the court\u2019s findings must be made in writing or placed orally in the record.  (f) Posttrial procedure  (1)  If the defendant is found mentally competent, the court must reinstate the criminal proceedings.  (2)  If the defendant in a felony case is found to be mentally incompetent under section 1370 or the defendant in any criminal action is found to be mentally incompetent under section 1370.1 due to a developmental disability, the criminal proceedings remain suspended and the court either:  (A) Must issue an order committing the person for restoration treatment under the provisions of the governing statute; or   (B) In the case of a person eligible for commitment under sections 1370, if the person is found incompetent due to a mental disorder, may consider placing the person on a program of diversion under section 1001.36 in lieu of commitment.  (3) If the defendant is found to be mentally incompetent in a misdemeanor case under section 1370.01, the criminal proceedings remain suspended, and the court may dismiss the case under section 1385 or conduct a hearing to consider placing the person on a program of diversion under section 1001.36  (Subd (f) amended effective May 13, 2022; previously amended effective January 1, 2020.)  (g) Reinstatement of felony proceedings under section 1001.36(d)  If a defendant eligible for commitment under section 1370 is granted diversion under section 1001.36, and during the period of diversion, the court determines that criminal proceedings should be reinstated under section 1001.36(d), the court must, under section 1369, appoint a psychiatrist, licensed psychologist, or any other expert the court may deem appropriate, to examine the defendant and return a report opining on the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. The expert\u2019s report must be provided to counsel for the People and to the defendant\u2019s counsel.  29  (1) On receipt of the evaluation report, the court must conduct an inquiry into the defendant\u2019s current competency, under the procedures set forth in (h)(2) of this rule.  (2) If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is mentally competent, the court must hold a hearing as set forth in Penal Code section 1001.36(d).  (3) If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is mentally incompetent, criminal proceedings must remain suspended, and the court must order that the defendant be committed and placed for restoration treatment.  (4) If the court concludes, based on substantial evidence, that the defendant is mentally incompetent and is not likely to attain competency within the time remaining before the defendant\u2019s maximum date for returning to court, and has reason to believe the defendant may be gravely disabled, within the meaning of Welfare and Institutions Code section 5008(h)(1), the court may, instead of issuing a commitment order under section 1370, refer the matter to the conservatorship investigator of the county of commitment to initiate conservatorship proceedings for the defendant under Welfare and Institutions Code section 5350 et seq.  (Subd (g) amended effective May 13, 2022; adopted effective January 1, 2020; previously amended effective September 1, 2020.)  (h) Posttrial hearings on competence under section 1370  (1) If, at any time after the court has declared a defendant incompetent to stand trial, and counsel for the defendant, or a jail medical or mental health staff provider, provides the court with substantial evidence that the defendant\u2019s psychiatric symptoms have changed to such a degree as to create a doubt in the mind of the judge as to the defendant\u2019s current mental incompetence, the court may appoint a psychiatrist or a licensed psychologist to examine the defendant and, in an examination with the court, opine as to whether the defendant has regained competence.   (2) On receipt of an evaluation report under (h)(1) or an evaluation by the State Department of State Hospitals under Welfare and Institutions Code section 4335.2, the court must direct the clerk to serve a copy on counsel for the People and counsel for the defendant. If, in the opinion of the appointed expert or the department\u2019s expert, the defendant has regained competence, the court must conduct a hearing, as if a certificate of restoration of competence had been filed under section 1372(a)(1), except that a presumption of competency does not apply. At the hearing, the court may  30 consider any evidence, presented by any party, that is relevant to the question of the defendant\u2019s current mental competency.  (A) At the conclusion of the hearing, if the court finds that it has been established by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is mentally competent, the court must reinstate criminal proceedings.  (B)  At the conclusion of the hearing, if the court finds that it has not been established by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is mentally competent, criminal proceedings must remain suspended.  (C) The court\u2019s findings on the defendant\u2019s mental competency must be stated on the record and recorded in the minutes.  (Subd (h) amended effective May 13, 2022; adopted effective January 1, 2020.)  Rule 4.130 amended effective May 13, 2022; adopted effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2018, January 1, 2020, and September 1, 2020.  Advisory Committee Comment  The case law interpreting Penal Code section 1367 et seq. established a procedure for judges to follow in cases where there is a concern whether the defendant is legally competent to stand trial, but the concern does not necessarily rise to the level of a reasonable doubt based on substantial evidence. Before finding a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial and initiating competency proceedings under Penal Code section 1368 et seq., the court may appoint an expert to assist the court in determining whether such a reasonable doubt exists. As noted in People v. Visciotti  (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1, 34\u201336, the court may appoint an expert when it is concerned about the mental competency of the defendant, but the concern does not rise to the level of a reasonable doubt, based on substantial evidence, required by Penal Code section 1367 et seq. Should the results of this examination present substantial evidence of mental incompetency, the court must initiate competency proceedings under (b).
