{"prompt": "Each year, the Judicial Council will make available to the superior courts a list of all noncapital cases in which the California Supreme Court has issued a written opinion.   Subdivision (j).  Because the destruction of court records is discretionary, all courts may elect to apply the rule retroactively and destroy court records that are not required to be preserved under subdivisions (c), (d), and (f), but they are not required to do so.  Superior courts that destroyed court records under the prior sampling rule may have preserved only 10 percent of their records (formerly known as the \u201csystematic sample\u201d) for the year that they are now assigned to preserve the sample defined in subdivision (f). Except for the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, these courts would not be able to meet the requirement in subdivision (f)(1). So long as these courts continue preserving the 10-percent sample for their assigned year, they will be deemed to have satisfied subdivision (f)(1).   262  Rule 10.856.
