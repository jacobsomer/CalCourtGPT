(7) In making the determination under (a)(6), the court must exercise its discretion after consideration of the following factors:  (A) The relative length of custody or supervision required for each case;  (B) Whether the cases in each county are to be served concurrently or consecutively;  (C) The nature and quality of treatment programs available in each county, if known;  (D) The nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s current enrollment and participation in any treatment program;  (E) The nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s ties to the community, including employment, duration of residence, family attachments, and property holdings;  (F) The nature and extent of supervision available in each county, if known;  (G) The factors listed in rule 4.530(f); and  (H) Any other factor relevant to such determination.  (8) If after the court\u2019s determination in accordance with (a)(6) the defendant is ordered to serve only a custody term without supervision in another county, the defendant must be transported at such time and under such circumstances as the court directs to the county where the custody term is to be served. The defendant must be transported with an abstract of the court\u2019s judgment as required by section 1213(a), or other suitable documentation showing the term imposed by the court and any custody credits against the sentence.

Advisory Committee Comment  The restrictions of (a)(3) do not apply to circumstances where a previously imposed base term is made a consecutive term on resentencing. If the court selects a consecutive sentence structure, and since there can be only one principal term in the final aggregate sentence, if a previously imposed full base term becomes a subordinate consecutive term, the new consecutive term normally will become one-third the middle term by operation of law (section 1170.1(a)).

Rule 4.480.  Judge\u2019s statement under section 1203.01  A sentencing judge\u2019s statement of his or her views under section 1203.01 respecting a person sentenced to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Adult Operations is required only in the event that no probation report is filed. Even though it is not required, however, a statement should be submitted by the judge in any case in which  99 he or she believes that the correctional handling and the determination of term and parole should be influenced by information not contained in other court records.  The purpose of a section 1203.01 statement is to provide assistance to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Adult Operations in its programming and institutional assignment and to the Board of Parole Hearings with reference to term fixing and parole release of persons sentenced indeterminately, and parole and postrelease community supervision waiver of persons sentenced determinately. It may amplify any reasons for the sentence that may bear on a possible suggestion by the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or the Board of Parole Hearings that the sentence and commitment be recalled and the defendant be resentenced. To be of maximum assistance to these agencies, a judge\u2019s statements should contain individualized comments concerning the convicted offender, any special circumstances that led to a prison sentence rather than local incarceration, and any other significant information that might not readily be available in any of the accompanying official records and reports.  If a section 1203.01 statement is prepared, it should be submitted no later than two weeks after sentencing so that it may be included in the official Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Adult Operations case summary that is prepared during the time the offender is being processed at the Reception-Guidance Center of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Adult Operations.
