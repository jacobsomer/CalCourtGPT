Judicial branch education  (a) Purpose  Judicial branch education for all justices, judges, subordinate judicial officers, and court personnel is essential to enhance the fair, effective, and efficient administration of justice. Participation in education activities is part of the official duties of judicial officers and court personnel. Judicial branch education is acknowledged as a vital component in achieving the goals of the Judicial Council\u2019s Long-Range Strategic Plan, which include access, fairness, and diversity; branch independence and accountability; modernization of management and administration; and quality of justice and service to the public. The responsibility for planning, conducting, and overseeing judicial branch education properly resides in the judicial branch.  (b) Education objectives  Justices, judges, subordinate judicial officers, court personnel, education committees, and others who plan and deliver education will endeavor to achieve the following objectives:  (1) To provide justices, judges, subordinate judicial officers, and court personnel with the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform their responsibilities competently, fairly, and efficiently;  (2) To ensure that education, including opportunities for orientation, continuing education, and professional development, is available to all justices, judges, subordinate judicial officers, and court personnel;  (3) To assist justices, judges, subordinate judicial officers, and court personnel in preserving the integrity and impartiality of the judicial system through their efforts to ensure that all members of the public have equal access to the  110 courts and equal ability to participate in court proceedings and are treated in a fair and just manner;  (4) To promote the adherence of justices, judges, subordinate judicial officers, and court personnel to the highest ideals of personal and official conduct, as set forth in the California Code of Judicial Ethics and the Code of Ethics for the Court Employees of California;  (5) To improve the administration of justice, reduce court delay, and promote fair and efficient management of court proceedings;  (6) To promote standardized court practices and procedures; and  (7) To implement the recommendations adopted by the Judicial Council in the California Standards of Judicial Administration.  Rule 10.451 adopted effective January 1, 2007.  Rule 10.452.  Minimum education requirements, expectations, and recommendations  (a) Purpose  Justices, judges, and subordinate judicial officers are entrusted by the public with the impartial and knowledgeable handling of proceedings that affect the freedom, livelihood, and happiness of the people involved. Court personnel assist justices, judges, and subordinate judicial officers in carrying out their responsibilities and must provide accurate and timely services to the public. Justices, judges, subordinate judicial officers, and court staff members are individually responsible for maintaining and improving their professional competence. To assist them in enhancing their professional competence, the judicial branch will develop and maintain a comprehensive and high-quality education program, including minimum education requirements, expectations, and recommendations, to provide educational opportunities for all justices, judges, subordinate judicial officers, and court personnel.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2023; previously amended effective January 1, 2008.)  (b) Goals  The minimum education requirements, expectations, and recommendations stated in rules 10.461\u201310.479 are intended to achieve two complementary goals:  (1) To ensure that all justices, judges, subordinate judicial officers, and court personnel obtain education on the tasks, skills, abilities, and knowledge necessary to be successful in their new court assignments and roles; and  111   (2) To establish broad continuing education parameters, based on multiyear education cycles, for experienced individuals while preserving the ability of these individuals, working with the persons overseeing their work, to determine appropriate education content and providers.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2023; previously amended effective January 1, 2008.)  (c) Relationship of minimum education requirements and expectations to education recommendations  The education requirements and expectations stated in rules 10.461, 10.462, and 10.471\u201310.474 are minimums. Justices, judges, and subordinate judicial officers should participate in more judicial education than is required and expected, related to each individual\u2019s responsibilities and judicial assignments and in accordance with the judicial education recommendations stated in rule 10.469. Additional education requirements related to specific responsibilities are stated in rule 10.463 (for those hearing family law matters), rule 10.464 (for those hearing domestic violence issues), and rule 10.468 (for those hearing probate proceedings).  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2023; previously amended effective January 1, 2008, and January 1, 2012.)  (d) Responsibilities of Chief Justice and administrative presiding justices  The Chief Justice and each administrative presiding justice:  (1) Must grant sufficient leave to Supreme Court and Court of Appeal justices, the clerk/executive officer, and the managing attorney to complete the minimum education requirements stated in rules 10.461, 10.471, and 10.472, respectively;  (2) To the extent compatible with the efficient administration of justice, must grant to all justices, the clerk/executive officer, and the managing attorney sufficient leave to participate in education programs consistent with the education recommendations stated in rules 10.469 and 10.479. After a justice has completed any new justice education required under rule 10.461 or after a justice has completed the first year on the bench, the Chief Justice or the administrative presiding justice should grant each justice at least eight court days per calendar year to participate in continuing education relating to the justice\u2019s responsibilities;  (3) In addition to the educational leave required under (d)(1)\u2013(2), should grant leave to a justice, clerk/executive officer, or managing attorney to serve on  112 education committees and as a faculty member at education programs when the individual\u2019s services have been requested for judicial or legal education;  (4) Should establish an education plan for the court to facilitate the involvement of justices, the clerk/executive officer, and the managing attorney as both participants and faculty in education activities;  (5) Must ensure that justices, the clerk/executive officer, and the managing attorney are reimbursed by their court in accordance with the travel policies issued by the Judicial Council for travel expenses incurred in attending in-state education programs as a participant, except to the extent that: (i) certain expenses are covered by the Judicial Council; or (ii) the education provider or sponsor of the program pays the expenses. Provisions for these expenses must be part of every court\u2019s budget. The Chief Justice or the administrative presiding justice may approve reimbursement of travel expenses incurred by justices, the clerk/executive officer, and the managing attorney in attending out-of-state education programs as a participant; and  (6) Must retain the records and cumulative histories of participation provided by justices. These records and cumulative histories are subject to periodic audit by Judicial Council staff. The Chief Justice and the administrative presiding justices must report their courts\u2019 compliance with education requirements on an aggregate basis to the Judicial Council, on a form provided by the Judicial Council, within six months after the end of each three-year education cycle.  \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
