{"prompt": "Subdivision (c)(7). Under Penal Code section 1170(h)(5)(B), defendants serving a period of mandatory supervision are entitled to day-for-day credits: \u201cDuring the period when the defendant is under such supervision, unless in actual custody related to the sentence imposed by the court, the defendant shall be entitled to only actual time credit against the term of imprisonment imposed by the court.\u201d In contrast, defendants serving terms of imprisonment in county jails under Penal Code section 1170(h) are entitled to conduct credits under Penal Code section 4019(a)(6).  Subdivision (c)(8). Standard 4.35 of the California Standards of Judicial Administration provides courts with additional guidance on using the results of a risk/needs assessment at sentencing.  73  Rule 4.420.  Selection of term of imprisonment  (a) When a judgment of imprisonment is imposed, or the execution of a judgment of imprisonment is ordered suspended, the sentencing judge must, in their sound discretion, order imposition of a sentence not to exceed the middle term, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b).  (Subd (a) amended effective March 14, 2022; previously amended effective July 28, 1977, January 1, 1991, January 1, 2007, and May 23, 2007.)  (b) The court may only choose an upper term when (1) there are circumstances in aggravation of the crime that justify the imposition of an upper term, and (2) the facts underlying those circumstances have been (i) stipulated to by the defendant, (ii) found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by a jury, or (iii) found true beyond a reasonable doubt by the judge in a court trial.  (Subd (b) adopted effective March 14, 2022.)  (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b), the court may consider the fact of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions based on a certified record of conviction without it having been stipulated to by the defendant or found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by a jury or the judge in a court trial. This exception does not apply to the use of the record of a prior conviction in selecting the upper term of an enhancement.   (Subd (c) adopted effective March 14, 2022.)   (d) In selecting between the middle and lower terms of imprisonment, the sentencing judge may consider circumstances in aggravation or mitigation, and any other factor reasonably related to the sentencing decision. The court may consider factors in aggravation and mitigation, whether or not the factors have been stipulated to by the defendant or found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by a jury or the judge in a court trial. The relevant circumstances may be obtained from the case record, the probation officer\u2019s report, other reports and statements properly received, statements in aggravation or mitigation, and any evidence introduced at the sentencing hearing.  (Subd (d) relettered and amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted as Subd (b); previously amended effective July 28, 1977, January 1, 1991, January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, January 1, 2008, and January 1, 2017.)  (e) Notwithstanding section 1170(b)(1), and unless the court finds that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances such that imposition of the lower term would be contrary to the interests of justice, the court must order  74 imposition of the lower term if any of the following was a contributing factor in the commission of the offense:   (1) The defendant has experienced psychological, physical, or childhood trauma, including, but not limited to, abuse, neglect, exploitation, or sexual violence;  (2) The defendant is a youth, or was a youth as defined under section 1016.7(b) at the time of the commission of the offense; or  (3) Prior to the instant offense, or at the time of the commission of the offense, the defendant is or was a victim of intimate partner violence or human trafficking.   (Subd (e) adopted effective March 14, 2022.)   (f) Paragraph (e) does not preclude the court from imposing the lower term even if there is no evidence of the circumstances listed in paragraph (e).  (Subd (f) adopted effective March 14, 2022.)  (g) To comply with section 1170(b)(5), a fact charged and found as an enhancement may be used as a reason for imposing a particular term only if the court has discretion to strike the punishment for the enhancement and does so. The use of a fact of an enhancement to impose the upper term of imprisonment is an adequate reason for striking the additional term of imprisonment, regardless of the effect on the total term.  (Subd (g) relettered and amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted as Subd (c) effective January 1, 1991; previously amended effective January 1, 2018.  (h) A fact that is an element of the crime on which punishment is being imposed may not be used to impose a particular term.  (Subd (h) relettered effective March 14, 2022; adopted as Subd (d) effective January 1, 1991; previously amended effective January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, and January 1, 2018.)  (i) The reasons for selecting one of the three authorized terms of imprisonment referred to in section 1170(b) must be stated orally on the record.  (Subd (i) relettered effective March 14, 2022; previously amended and relettered effective January 1, 1991; previously amended effective July 28, 1977, January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, and January 1, 2017.)   75 Rule 4.420 amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted as rule 439 effective July 1, 1977; previously amended and renumbered as rule 420 effective January 1, 1991; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective July 28, 1977, January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, January 1, 2008, January 1, 2017, and January 1, 2018.  Advisory Committee Comment  It is not clear whether the reasons stated by the judge for selecting a particular term qualify as \u201cfacts\u201d for the purposes of the rule prohibition on dual use of facts. Until the issue is clarified, judges should avoid the use of reasons that may constitute an impermissible dual use of facts. For example, the court is not permitted to use a reason to impose a greater term if that reason also is either (1) the same as an enhancement that will be imposed, or (2) an element of the crime. The court should not use the same reason to impose a consecutive sentence as to impose an upper term of imprisonment. ( People v. Avalos  (1984) 37 Cal.3d 216, 233.) It is not improper to use the same reason to deny probation and to impose the upper term. ( People v. Bowen (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 102, 106.)  The rule makes it clear that a fact charged and found as an enhancement may, in the alternative, be used as a factor in aggravation.  People v. Riolo  (1983) 33 Cal.3d 223, 227 (and note 5 on 227) held that section 1170.1(a) does not require the judgment to state the base term (upper, middle, or lower) and enhancements, computed independently, on counts that are subject to automatic reduction under the one-third formula of section 1170.1(a).  Even when sentencing is under section 1170.1, however, it is essential to determine the base term and specific enhancements for each count independently, in order to know which is the principal term count. The principal term count must be determined before any calculation is made using the one-third formula for subordinate terms.  In addition, the base term (upper, middle, or lower) for each count must be determined to arrive at an informed decision whether to make terms consecutive or concurrent; and the base term for each count must be stated in the judgment when sentences are concurrent or are fully consecutive (i.e., not subject to the one-third rule of section 1170.1(a)).  Case law suggests that in determining the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d the court should consider the constitutional rights of the defendant and the interests of society represented by the people; the defendant\u2019s background and prospects, including the presence or absence of a record; the nature and circumstances of the crime and the defendant\u2019s level of involvement; the factors in aggravation and mitigation including the specific factors in mitigation of Penal Code section 1170(b)(6); and the factors that would motivate a \u201creasonable judge\u201d in the exercise of their discretion. The court should not consider whether the defendant has simply pled guilty, factors related to controlling the court\u2019s calendar, or antipathy toward the statutory scheme. (See People v. Romero  (1996) 13 Cal.4th 947; People v. Dent  (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1726; People v. Kessel (1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 322; People v. Orin  (1975) 13 Cal.3d 937.)  Rule 4.421.  Circumstances in aggravation  Circumstances in aggravation include factors relating to the crime and factors relating to the defendant.  76  (a) Factors relating to the crime  Factors relating to the crime, whether or not charged or chargeable as enhancements include that:  (1) The crime involved great violence, great bodily harm, threat of great bodily harm, or other acts disclosing a high degree of cruelty, viciousness, or callousness;  (2) The defendant was armed with or used a weapon at the time of the commission of the crime;  (3) The victim was particularly vulnerable;  (4) The defendant induced others to participate in the commission of the crime or occupied a position of leadership or dominance of other participants in its commission;  (5) The defendant induced a minor to commit or assist in the commission of the crime;  (6) The defendant threatened witnesses, unlawfully prevented or dissuaded witnesses from testifying, suborned perjury, or in any other way illegally interfered with the judicial process;  (7) The defendant was convicted of other crimes for which consecutive sentences could have been imposed but for which concurrent sentences are being imposed;  (8) The manner in which the crime was carried out indicates planning, sophistication, or professionalism;  (9) The crime involved an attempted or actual taking or damage of great monetary value;  (10) The crime involved a large quantity of contraband; and  (11) The defendant took advantage of a position of trust or confidence to commit the offense.  (12) The crime constitutes a hate crime under section 422.55 and:  (A) No hate crime enhancements under section 422.75 are imposed; and  (B) The crime is not subject to sentencing under section 1170.8.   77  (Subd (a) amended effective May 23, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 1991, and January 1, 2007.)  (b) Factors relating to the defendant  Factors relating to the defendant include that:  (1) The defendant has engaged in violent conduct that indicates a serious danger to society;  (2) The defendant\u2019s prior convictions as an adult or sustained petitions in juvenile delinquency proceedings are numerous or of increasing seriousness;  (3) The defendant has served a prior term in prison or county jail under section 1170(h);  (4) The defendant was on probation, mandatory supervision, postrelease community supervision, or parole when the crime was committed; and  (5) The defendant\u2019s prior performance on probation, mandatory supervision, postrelease community supervision, or parole was unsatisfactory.
