(e) Cochairs  The Chief Justice appoints a state appellate justice or trial court judge and a tribal court appellate justice or judge to serve as cochairs, consistent with rule 10.31(c).  Rule 10.60 amended effective February 1, 2018; adopted effective October 25, 2013.  Judicial Council Comment  Tribes are recognized as distinct, independent political nations (see Worcester v. Georgia  (1832) 31 U.S. 515, 559, and Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez  (1978) 436 U.S. 49, 55, citing Worcester ), which retain inherent authority to establish their own form of government, including tribal justice systems. (25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3601(4).) Tribal justice systems are an essential part of tribal governments and serve to ensure the public health and safety and the political integrity of tribal governments. (25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3601(5).) Traditional tribal justice practices are essential to the maintenance of the culture and identity of tribes. (25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3601(7).)  The constitutional recognition of tribes as sovereigns in a government-to-government relationship with all other sovereigns is a well-established principle of federal Indian law. (See Cohen\u2019s Handbook of Federal Indian Law  (2005) p. 207.) In recognition of this sovereignty, the council\u2019s oversight of the forum, through an internal committee under rule 10.30(d), is limited to oversight of the forum\u2019s work and activities and does not include oversight of any tribe or tribal court.

To improve the administration of the courts, article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution requires the council to survey judicial business and make recommendations. To ensure that the fiscal affairs of the courts are managed efficiently, effectively, and responsibly, Government Code section 77206 authorizes the council to regulate the fiscal management of the courts and provides for audits of the courts and Judicial Council staff by the council, its representatives, and other entities. Government Code section 77009(h) provides that the \u201cJudicial Council or its representatives may perform audits, reviews, and investigations of superior court operations and records wherever they may be located.\u201d The Public Contract Code provides that the council shall publish a Judicial Branch Contracting Manual  (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 19206). It also provides that the California State  63 Auditor, subject to appropriations, shall biennially identify and audit five or more judicial branch entities to assess the implementation of the California Judicial Branch Contract Law (JBCL) (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 19210(a), (b)) and shall biennially conduct audits of Judicial Council staff to assess the implementation of, and compliance with, the JBCL (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 19210(c)).  Rule 10.64.
