Advisory Committee Comment  Family Code section 8600.5 exempts tribal customary adoption from various provisions of the Family Code applicable to adoptions generally, including section 8602, which requires the consent of a child over the age of 12 to an adoption. However, under Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.24(c)(7), \u201c[t]he child, birth parents, or Indian custodian and the tribal customary adoptive parents and their counsel, if applicable, may present evidence to the tribe regarding the tribal customary adoption and the child\u2019s best interest.\u201d Under Welfare and Institutions Code section 317(e), for all children over 4 years of age, the attorney for the child must determine the child\u2019s wishes and advise the court of the child\u2019s wishes. Welfare and Institutions Code section 361.31(e) provides that \u201c[w]here appropriate, the placement preference of the Indian child, when of sufficient age, . . . shall be considered.\u201d This is consistent with Guideline F-3 of the Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings  issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs on November 26, 1979, which recognizes that the request and wishes of a child of sufficient age are important in making an effective placement. The committee concludes, therefore, that while the consent of a child over the age of 12 is not required for a tribal customary adoption, the wishes of a child are still an important and appropriate factor for the court to consider and for children\u2019s counsel to ascertain and present to the court when determining whether tribal customary adoption is the appropriate permanent plan for an Indian child.   536 Rule 5.735.

(b) Notice; hearing  Unless the court proceeds under section 360(a) at the dispositional hearing, notice of the hearing at which the court considers appointing a legal guardian must be given under section 294, and the hearing must be conducted under the procedures in section 366.26.
