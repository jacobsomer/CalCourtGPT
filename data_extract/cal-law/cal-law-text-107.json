Rule 5.235.  Ex parte communication in child custody proceedings  Rule 5.235.  Ex parte communication in child custody proceedings  (a) Purpose  Generally, ex parte communication is prohibited in legal proceedings. In child custody proceedings, Family Code section 216 recognizes specific circumstances in which ex parte communication is permitted between court-connected or court-appointed child custody mediators or evaluators and the attorney for any party, the court-appointed counsel for a child, or the court. This rule of court establishes mandatory statewide standards of practice relating to when, and between whom, ex parte communication is permitted in child custody proceedings. This rule applies to all court-ordered child custody mediations or evaluations. As in Family Code section 216, this rule of court does not restrict communications between a court-connected or court-appointed child custody mediator or evaluator and a party in a child custody proceeding who is self-represented or represented by counsel.   107 (b) Definitions  For purposes of this rule:  (1) \u201cCommunication\u201d includes any verbal statement made in person, by telephone, by voicemail, or by videoconferencing; any written statement, illustration, photograph, or other tangible item, contained in a letter, document, e-mail, or fax; or other equivalent means, either directly or through third parties.  (2) \u201cEx parte communication\u201d is a direct or indirect communication on the substance of a pending case without the knowledge, presence, or consent of all parties involved in the matter.  (3) A \u201ccourt-connected mediator or evaluator\u201d is a superior court employee or a person under contract with a superior court who conducts child custody evaluations or mediations.  (4) A \u201ccourt-appointed mediator or evaluator\u201d is a professional in private practice appointed by the court to conduct a child custody evaluation or mediation.
