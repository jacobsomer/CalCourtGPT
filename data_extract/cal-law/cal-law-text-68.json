(b) Minimum information in reminder notice   In addition to information obtained from the Notice to Appear , the reminder notice must contain at least the following information:  (1) An appearance date and location;  (2)  Whether a court appearance is mandatory or optional;   13 (3) The total bail amount and payment options;  (4) The notice about traffic school required under Vehicle Code section 42007, if applicable;  (5) Notice that a traffic violator school will charge a fee in addition to the administrative fee charged by the court;  (6) The potential consequences for failure to appear, including a driver\u2019s license hold or suspension, a civil assessment of up to $300, a new charge for failure to appear, a warrant of arrest, or some combination of these consequences, if applicable;  (7) The potential consequences for failure to pay a fine, including a driver\u2019s license hold or suspension, a civil assessment of up to $300, a new charge for failure to pay a fine, a warrant of arrest, or some combination of these consequences, if applicable;  (8) The right to request an ability-to-pay determination;   (9) Notice of the option to pay bail through community service (if available) and installment plans (if available);   (10) Contact information for the court, including the court\u2019s website;  (11) Information regarding trial by declaration, informal trial (if available), and telephone or website scheduling options (if available); and  (12) Correction requirements and procedures for correctable violations.

The court may provide a means for obtaining the defendant\u2019s consent and designated electronic address or number on its local website. Because notices to appear state the website address for the superior court in each county, this location may increase the number of defendants who become aware and take advantage of this option. To obtain the defendant\u2019s electronic address or number at the time of signing the promise to appear, the court may need to collaborate with local law enforcement agencies.   Subdivision (b). While not required, some local court websites may provide information about local court processes and local forms related to the information on the reminder notice. If in electronic form, the reminder notice should include direct links to any information and forms on the local court website. If in paper form, the reminder notice may include the website addresses for any information and forms on the local court website.   14 Rule 4.108.
