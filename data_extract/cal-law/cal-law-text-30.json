If the notification pertains to a final order of contempt, Business and Professions Code section 6086.7(a)(1) requires the court to transmit to the State Bar a copy of the relevant minutes, final order, and transcript, if one  183 exists. This rule is intended to clarify who has the responsibility of notifying the State Bar under section 6086.7 and the required contents of the notice.  In addition to the requirements stated in Business and Professions Code section 6086.7, judges are subject to canon 3D(2) of the California Code of Judicial Ethics, which states: \u201cWhenever a judge has personal knowledge, or concludes in a judicial decision, that a lawyer has committed misconduct or has violated any provision of the Rules of Professional Conduct, the judge shall take appropriate corrective action, which may include reporting the violation to the appropriate authority.\u201d The Advisory Committee Commentary states: \u201cAppropriate corrective action could include direct communication with the judge or lawyer who has committed the violation, other direct action, such as a confidential referral to a judicial or lawyer assistance program, or a report of the violation to the presiding judge, appropriate authority, or other agency or body. Judges should note that in addition to the action required by Canon 3D(2), California law imposes mandatory additional reporting requirements on judges regarding lawyer misconduct.
