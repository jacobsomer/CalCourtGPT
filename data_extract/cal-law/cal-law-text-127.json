(3) If it appears that there is good cause to deny a transfer, the court must hold an evidentiary hearing on the transfer and make its findings on the record.   226 (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2020; previously amended effective January 1, 2013.)  (e) Evidentiary burdens  (1) The burden of establishing good cause to deny a request to transfer is on the party opposing the transfer.  (2) If the court believes, or any party asserts, that good cause to deny the request exists, the reasons for that belief or assertion must be stated orally on the record or in writing, in advance of the hearing, and made available to all parties who are requesting the transfer, and the petitioner must have the opportunity to provide information or evidence in rebuttal of the belief or assertion.

Advisory Committee Comment   228 Once a transfer to tribal court is finalized as provided in rule 5.483(h), the appellate court lacks jurisdiction to order the case returned to state court ( In re M.M. (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 897).  As stated by the Court of Appeal in In re M.M ., the juvenile court has the discretion to stay the provisions of a judgment or order awarding, changing, or affecting custody of a minor child \u201cpending review on appeal or for any other period or periods that it may deem appropriate\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 917.7), and the party seeking review of the transfer order should first request a stay in the lower court. (See Nuckolls v. Bank of California, Nat. Assn. (1936) 7 Cal.2d 574, 577 [61 P.2d 927] [\u201cInasmuch as the [L]egislature has provided a method by which the trial court, in a proper case, may grant the stay, the appellate courts, assuming that they have the power, should not, except in some unusual emergency, exercise their power until the petitioner has first presented the matter to the trial court.\u201d].) If the juvenile court should deny the stay request, the aggrieved party may then petition this court for a writ of supersedeas pending appeal. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.112).  Subdivision (g) and this advisory committee comment are added to help ensure that an objecting party does not inadvertently lose the right to appeal a transfer order.  Former rule 5.484.

Emergency proceedings involving an Indian child  (a) Standards for removal  Whenever it is known or there is reason to know the case involves an Indian child, the court may not order an emergency removal or placement of the child without a finding that the removal or placement is necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child. The petition requesting emergency removal or continued emergency placement of the child or its accompanying documents must contain the following:  (1) A statement of the risk of imminent physical damage or harm to the child and any evidence that the emergency removal or placement continues to be necessary to prevent such imminent physical damage or harm to the child;  (2) The name, age, and last known address of the Indian child;  (3) The name and address of the child\u2019s parents and Indian custodian, if any;  (4) The steps taken to provide notice to the child\u2019s parents, Indian custodian, and tribe about the emergency proceeding;   229 (5) If the child\u2019s parents and Indian custodian are unknown, a detailed explanation of what efforts have been made to locate and contact them;  (6) The residence and the domicile of the Indian child;  (7) If either the residence or the domicile of the Indian child is believed to be on a reservation or in an Alaska Native village, the name of the tribe affiliated with that reservation or village;  (8) The tribal affiliation of the child and of the parents or Indian custodian;  (9) A specific and detailed account of the circumstances that led to the emergency removal of the child;  (10) If the child is believed to reside or be domiciled on a reservation where the tribe exercises exclusive jurisdiction over child custody matters, a statement of efforts that have been made and are being made to contact the tribe and transfer the child to the tribe\u2019s jurisdiction; and  (11) A statement of the efforts that have been taken to assist the parents or Indian custodian so the Indian child may safely be returned to their custody.  (b) Return of Indian child when emergency situation has ended  (1) Whenever it is known or there is reason to know the child is an Indian child and there has been an emergency removal of the child from parental custody, any party who asserts that there is new information indicating that the emergency situation has ended may request an ex parte hearing by filing a request on Request for Ex Parte Hearing to Return Physical Custody of an Indian Child (form ICWA-070) to determine whether the emergency situation has ended.  (2) If the request provides evidence of new information establishing that the emergency placement is no longer necessary, the court must promptly schedule a hearing. At the hearing the court must consider whether the child\u2019s removal and placement is still necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child. If the court determines that the child\u2019s emergency removal or placement is no longer necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child, the court must order the child returned to the physical custody of the parents or Indian custodian.   230 (3) In accordance with rules 3.10 and 3.20, this procedure is governed by the provisions of division 6, chapter 3 and division 11, chapter 4 of title 3 of the California Rules of Court.  (c) Time limitation on emergency proceedings  An emergency removal must not continue for more than 30 days unless the court makes the following determinations:  (1) Restoring the child to the parent or Indian custodian would subject the child to imminent physical damage or harm;  (2) The court has been unable to transfer the proceeding to the jurisdiction of the appropriate Indian tribe; and  (3) It has not been possible to have a hearing that complies with the substantive requirements of the Indian Child Welfare Act for a foster care placement proceeding.

Placement of an Indian child  (a) Evidentiary burdens  In any child custody proceeding listed in rule 5.480, the court may not order placement of an Indian child unless it finds by clear and convincing evidence that continued custody with the parent or Indian custodian is likely to cause the Indian child serious emotional or physical damage and it considers evidence regarding prevailing social and cultural standards of the child\u2019s tribe, including that tribe\u2019s family organization and child-rearing practices.  (1) Testimony by a \u201cqualified expert witness,\u201d as defined in Welfare and Institutions Code section 224.6, Family Code section 177(a), and Probate Code section 1459.5(b), is required before a court orders a child placed in foster care or terminates parental rights.  (2) Stipulation by the parent, Indian custodian, or tribe, or failure to object, may waive the requirement of producing evidence of the likelihood of serious damage only if the court is satisfied that the person or tribe has been fully  \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
