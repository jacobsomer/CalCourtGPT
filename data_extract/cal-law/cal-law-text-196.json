Rule 5.850  Sealing of records by probation in diversion cases (\u00a7 786.5)  (a) Applicability  This rule states the procedures to seal the records of persons who are subject to section 786.5.  (b) Determination of satisfactory completion   Within 60 days of the completion of a program of diversion or supervision under a referral by the probation officer or the prosecutor instead of filing a petition to adjudge the person a ward of the juvenile court, including a program of informal supervision under section 654, the probation department must determine whether the participant satisfactorily completed a program subject to this rule.  (Subd (b) adopted effective January 1, 2022.)  (c) Review of unsatisfactory completion of program by the juvenile court  If the probation department determines that the program has not been completed satisfactorily, it must notify the person in writing of the reason or reasons for not sealing the record and provide the person with a copy of the Petition to Review Denial of Sealing of Records After Diversion Program  (form JV-598) or similar local form to allow the person to seek court review of the probation department\u2019s determination within 60 days of making that determination, as well as a copy of How to Ask the Court to Seal Your Records (form JV-595-INFO) or other information on how to petition the court directly to seal arrest and other related records. A person who receives notice from the probation department that the program has not been satisfactorily completed and that the records have not been sealed may seek review of that determination by the court by submitting a petition to the probation department on the Petition to Review Denial of Sealing of Records After Diversion Program  (form JV-598) or similar local form, and the probation  623 department must file that petition with the court for a hearing to review whether the satisfactory completion requirement has been met and the records are eligible for sealing by the probation department. The petition must be provided to the probation department within 60 days of the date the notice from the probation department was sent, and must include a copy of that notice. The probation department must file the petition with the juvenile court in the county that issued the notice within 30 days of receiving it. The clerk of the court must set the matter for hearing and notify the petitioner and the probation department of the date, time, and location of the hearing. The court must appoint counsel to represent the youth before or at the hearing unless the court finds that the youth has made an intelligent waiver of the right to counsel under section 634 or is already represented. If the court finds after the hearing that the petitioner is eligible to have the records sealed under section 786.5, it must order the probation department to promptly comply with the sealing and notice requirements of this rule.  (Subd (c) adopted effective January 1, 2022.)  (d) Sealing of records  Upon satisfactory completion of a program of diversion or supervision subject to this rule, the probation department must seal the arrest and other records in its custody relating to the arrest or referral and participation in the program. The probation department must notify the arresting law enforcement agency to seal the records relating to the arrest and referral, and the arresting law enforcement agency must seal the records in its custody relating to the arrest, no later than 60 days from the date of the notification. Upon sealing, the law enforcement agency must notify the probation department that the records have been sealed. The probation department must also notify the public or private agency operating the diversion program to which the person has been referred to seal any records in its custody relating to the arrest or referral and participation in the program, and the operator of the program must do so no later than 60 days from the date of the notification by the probation department. Upon sealing, the public or private agency must notify the probation department that the records have been sealed.  (Subd (d) amended and relettered effective January 1, 2022; adopted as subd (b) effective 2018.)

Rule 5.850 amended effective January 1, 2022; adopted effective September 1, 2018.   Rule 5.860.  Prosecuting attorney request to access sealed juvenile case files  (a) Applicability    This rule applies when a prosecuting attorney is seeking to access, inspect, utilize, or disclose a record that has been sealed by the court under sections 781, 786, or 793, or Penal Code section 851.7, and the attorney has reason to believe that access to the record is necessary to meet the attorney\u2019s statutory or constitutional obligation to disclose favorable or exculpatory evidence to a defendant in a criminal case.  (b) Contents of the request  Any request filed with the juvenile court under this rule must include the prosecuting attorney\u2019s rationale for believing that access to the information in the record may be necessary to meet the disclosure obligation and the date by which the records are needed. The date must allow for sufficient time to meet the notice and hearing requirements of this rule. Form JV-592, Prosecutor Request for Access to Sealed Juvenile Case File, may be used for this purpose.  (c) Notice and opportunity to respond   (1) Notice requirements   (A) The request must include a form for the court to notify the person whose records are to be accessed as well as that person\u2019s attorney of record, and a form for those individuals to respond in writing and to request an appearance before the juvenile court. Forms JV-593, Notice of Prosecutor Request for Access to Sealed Juvenile Case File,  and JV-594, Response to Prosecutor Request for Access to Sealed Juvenile Case File, may be used for this purpose.  (B) The juvenile court must notify the person with the sealed record and that person\u2019s attorney of record using the documents prepared by the prosecuting attorney within two court days of the request being filed.  (2) Requirements if a response is filed    625 (A) If a written response is filed no more than 10 days after the date the notice was issued and no appearance has been requested, the clerk of the court must provide that response to the juvenile court for its consideration as it reviews the prosecuting attorney\u2019s request.  (B) If a response is filed no more than 10 days after the date the notice was issued and an appearance is requested, the clerk of the court must set a hearing and provide notice of the hearing to the person with the sealed record, the attorney of record for that person, and the prosecuting attorney who filed the request.   (d) Juvenile court review and order  The court must review the case file and records that have been referenced by the prosecuting attorney\u2019s request as well as any response provided as set forth in subdivision (c)(2). The court must approve the request, in whole or in part, if it determines that access to a specific sealed record or portion of a sealed record is necessary to enable the prosecuting attorney to comply with the disclosure obligation. If the court approves the request, the order must include appropriate limits on the access, inspection, utilization, and disclosure of the sealed record information in order to protect the confidentiality of the person whose sealed record is at issue. Such limits may include protective orders to accompany authorized disclosure, discovery, or access, including an order that the prosecuting attorney first submit the records to be disclosed to the court for its review and possible redaction to protect confidentiality. The court must make its initial order within 21 court days of when the request is filed, unless an appearance has been requested under subdivision (c)(2), in which case the court must act within five court days of the date set for the appearance.
