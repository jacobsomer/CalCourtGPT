If a notice of appeal is timely filed, the court must prepare and submit the record to the Court of Appeal within 20 days.   (2) An order denying a motion to transfer jurisdiction of a youth to the criminal court is not an appealable order. Appellate review of the order is by petition for extraordinary writ. Any petition for review of a judge\u2019s order denying a motion to transfer jurisdiction of the child to the criminal court, or denying an application for rehearing of the referee\u2019s determination not to transfer jurisdiction of the child to the criminal court, must be filed no later than 20 days after the judge\u2019s order is entered, or the referee\u2019s order becomes final under rule 5.540(c).
