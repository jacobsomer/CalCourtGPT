{"prompt": "circumstances is the court obligated to appoint more than two experts. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1369(a).) The costs of the experts appointed under (d) are to be paid for by the court as the expert examinations and reports are for the benefit or use of the court in determining whether the defendant is mentally incompetent. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.810, function 10.)  Subdivision (d)(3), which provides that the defendant\u2019s statements made during the examination cannot be used in a trial on the defendant\u2019s guilt or a sanity trial in a not guilty by reason of sanity trial, is based on the California Supreme Court holdings in People v. Arcega  (1982) 32 Cal.3d 504 and People v. Weaver  (2001) 26 Cal.4th 876.  Although the court is not obligated to appoint additional experts, counsel may nonetheless retain their own experts to testify at a trial on the defendant\u2019s competency. (See People v. Mayes  (1988) 202 Cal.App.4th 908, 917\u2013918.) These experts are not for the benefit or use of the court, and their costs are not to be paid by the court. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 10.810, function 10.)  31  Both the prosecution and the defense have the right to a jury trial. (See People v. Superior Court (McPeters)  (1995) 169 Cal.App.3d 796.) Defense counsel may waive this right, even over the objection of the defendant. ( People v. Masterson  (1994) 8 Cal.4th 965, 970.)   Either defense counsel or the prosecution (or both) may argue that the defendant is not competent to stand trial. ( People v. Stanley  (1995) 10 Cal.4th 764, 804 [defense counsel may advocate that defendant is not competent to stand trial and may present evidence of defendant\u2019s mental incompetency regardless of defendant\u2019s desire to be found competent].) If the defense declines to present evidence of the defendant\u2019s mental incompetency, the prosecution may do so. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1369(b)(2).) If the prosecution elects to present evidence of the defendant\u2019s mental incompetency, it is the prosecution\u2019s burden to prove the incompetency by a preponderance of the evidence. ( People v. Mixon  (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 1471, 1484, fn. 12.)  Should both parties decline to present evidence of defendant\u2019s mental incompetency, the court may do so. In those cases, the court is not to instruct the jury that a party has the burden of proof. \u201cRather, the proper approach would be to instruct the jury on the legal standard they are to apply to the evidence before them without allocating the burden of proof to one party or the other.\u201d (People v. Sherik  (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 444, 459\u2013460.)  Rule 4.131.  Probable cause determinations under section 1368.1(a)(2)   (a) Notice of a request for a determination of probable cause   The prosecuting attorney must serve and file notice of a request for a determination of probable cause on the defense at least 10 court days before the time appointed for the proceeding.   (b) Judge requirement  A judge must hear the determination of probable cause unless there is a stipulation by both parties to having the matter heard by a subordinate judicial officer.   (c) Defendant need not be present   A defendant need not be present for a determination of probable cause  to proceed.  (d) Application of section 861   The one-session requirement of section 861 does not apply.   (e) Transcript   A transcript of the determination of probable cause must be provided to the prosecuting attorney and counsel for the defendant  consistent with the manner in which a transcript is provided in a preliminary examination.

Change of venue: application and general provisions  (a) Application  Rules 4.150 to 4.155 govern the change of venue in criminal cases under Penal Code section 1033.  (Subd (a) adopted effective January 1, 2006.)  (b) General provisions   When a change of venue has been ordered, the case remains a case of the transferring court. Except on good cause to the contrary, the court must follow the provisions below:  (1) Proceedings before trial must be heard in the transferring court.  (2) Proceedings that are not to be heard by the trial judge must be heard in the transferring court.  (3) Postverdict proceedings, including sentencing, if any, must be heard in the transferring court.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted effective January 1, 2006.)  (c) Appellate review  Review by the Court of Appeal, either by an original proceeding or by appeal, must be heard in the appellate district in which the transferring court is located.  (Subd (c) adopted effective January 1, 2006.)   33 Rule 4.150 amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as rule 840 effective March 4, 1972; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2006.  Advisory Committee Comment   Subdivision (b)(1).  This subdivision is based on Penal Code section 1033(a), which provides that all proceedings before trial are to be heard in the transferring court, except when a particular proceeding must be heard by the trial judge.  Subdivision (b)(2).  This subdivision addresses motions heard by a judge other than the trial judge, such as requests for funds under Penal Code section 987.9 or a challenge or disqualification under Code of Civil Procedure section 170 et seq.  Subdivision (b)(3).  Reflecting the local community interest in the case, (b)(3) clarifies that after trial the case is to return to the transferring court for any posttrial proceedings. There may be situations where the local interest is outweighed, warranting the receiving court to conduct posttrial hearings. Such hearings may include motions for new trial where juror testimony is necessary and the convenience to the jurors outweighs the desire to conduct the hearings in the transferring court.  Subdivision (c).  This subdivision ensures that posttrial appeals and writs are heard in the same appellate district as any writs that may have been heard before or during trial.  Rule 4.151.  Motion for change of venue  (a) Motion procedure   A motion for change of venue in a criminal case under Penal Code section 1033 must be supported by a declaration stating the facts supporting the application. Except for good cause shown, the motion must be filed at least 10 days before the date set for trial, with a copy served on the adverse party at least 10 days before the hearing. At the hearing counterdeclarations may be filed.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted effective January 1, 2006; formerly part of an unlettered subd.)  (b) Policy considerations in ruling on motion  Before ordering a change of venue in a criminal case, the transferring court should consider impaneling a jury that would give the defendant a fair and impartial trial.  (Subd (b) adopted effective January 1, 2006.)  Rule 4.151 amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as rule 841 effective March 4, 1972; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2006.  Advisory Committee Comment   34  Rule 4.151(b) is not intended to imply that the court should attempt to impanel a jury in every case before granting a change of venue.  Rule 4.152.  Selection of court and trial judge  When a judge grants a motion for change of venue, he or she must inform the presiding judge of the transferring court. The presiding judge, or his or her designee, must:  (1) Notify the Administrative Director of the change of venue. After receiving the transferring court\u2019s notification, the Administrative Director, in order to expedite judicial business and equalize the work of the judges, must advise the transferring court which courts would not be unduly burdened by the trial of the case.   (2) Select the judge to try the case, as follows:  (A) The presiding judge, or his or her designee, must select a judge from the transferring court, unless he or she concludes that the transferring court does not have adequate judicial resources to try the case.  (B) If the presiding judge, or his or her designee, concludes that the transferring court does not have adequate judicial resources to try the case, he or she must request that the Chief Justice of California determine whether to assign a judge to the transferring court. If the Chief Justice determines not to assign a judge to the transferring court, the presiding judge, or his or her designee, must select a judge from the transferring court to try the case.  Rule 4.152 amended effective January 1, 2016; adopted as rule 842 effective March 4, 1972; previously amended and renumbered as rule 4.152 effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2006.   Rule 4.153.  Order on change of venue  After receiving the list of courts from the Administrative Director, the presiding judge, or his or her designee, must:  (1) Determine the court in which the case is to be tried. In making that determination, the court must consider, under Penal Code section 1036.7, whether to move the jury rather than to move the pending action. In so doing, the court should give particular consideration to the convenience of the jurors.  (2) Transmit to the receiving court a certified copy of the order of transfer and any pleadings, documents, or other papers or exhibits necessary for trying the case.  (3) Enter the order for change of venue in the minutes of the transferring court. The order must include the determinations in (1).  35  Rule 4.153 amended effective January 1, 2016; adopted as rule 843 effective March 4, 1972; previously amended and renumbered as rule 4.153 effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2006.  Advisory Committee Comment   Rules 4.152 and 4.153 recognize that, although the determination of whether to grant a motion for change of venue is judicial in nature, the selection of the receiving court and the decision whether the case should be tried by a judge of the transferring court are more administrative in nature. Thus, the rules provide that the presiding judge of the transferring court is to make the latter decisions. He or she may delegate those decisions to the trial judge, the supervising judge of the criminal division, or any other judge the presiding judge deems appropriate. If, under the particular facts of the case, the latter decisions are both judicial and administrative, those decisions may be more properly made by the judge who heard the motion for change of venue.
