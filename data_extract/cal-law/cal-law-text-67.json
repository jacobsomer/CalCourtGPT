{"prompt": "violation is reportable to the Department of Motor Vehicles.  (2) Ineligible offenses   A court clerk is not authorized to grant a request to attend traffic  violator school for a misdemeanor or any of the following infractions:  (A) A violation that carries a negligent operator point count of more than one point under Vehicle Code section 12810 or one and one-half points or more under Vehicle Code section 12810.5(b)(2);  (B) A violation that occurs within 18 months after the date of a previous violation and the defendant either attended or elected to attend a traffic violator school for the previous violation (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1808.7 and 1808.10);  6  (C) A violation of Vehicle Code section 22406.5 (tank vehicles);  (D) A violation related to alcohol use or possession or drug use or possession;  (E) A violation on which the defendant failed to appear under Vehicle Code section 40508(a) unless the failure-to-appear charge has been adjudicated and any fine imposed has been paid;  (F) A violation on which the defendant has failed to appear under Penal Code section 1214.1 unless the civil monetary assessment has been paid;  (G) A speeding violation in which the speed alleged is more than 25 miles over a speed limit as stated in Chapter 7 (commencing with section 22348) of Division 11 of the Vehicle Code; and  (H) A violation that occurs in a commercial vehicle as defined in Vehicle Code section 15210(b).  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2013; previously amended effective January 1, 2003, September 20, 2005, January 1, 2007; January 1, 2007, and July 1, 2011.)  (c) Judicial discretion   (1) A judicial officer may in his or her discretion order attendance at a traffic violator school in an individual case as permitted under Vehicle Code section 41501(a) or 42005 or for any other purpose permitted by law. A defendant having a class A, class B, or commercial class C driver\u2019s license may request to attend traffic violator school if the defendant was operating a vehicle requiring only a noncommercial class C or class M license. The record of conviction after completion of traffic violator school by a driver who holds a class A, class B, or commercial class C license must not be reported as confidential. A defendant charged with a violation that occurs in a commercial vehicle, as defined in Vehicle Code section 15210(b), is not eligible to attend traffic violator school under Vehicle Code sections 41501 or 42005 in lieu of adjudicating an offense, to receive a confidential conviction, or to avoid violator point counts.   (2) A defendant who is otherwise eligible for traffic violator school is not made ineligible by entering a plea other than guilty or by exercising his or her right to trial. A traffic violator school request must be considered based on the individual circumstances of the specific case. The court is not required to state on the record a reason for granting or denying a traffic violator school request.    7  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2013; amended and relettered as part of subd (b) effective January 1, 2003; previously amended effective January 1, 1998, September 20, 2005, January 1, 2007, January 1, 2007, and July 1, 201.)  Rule 4.104 amended effective January 1, 2013; adopted as rule 851 effective January 1, 1997; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 1998, July 1, 2001, January 1, 2003, September 20, 2005, January 1, 2007 and July 1, 2011.  Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivision (c)(1).  Rule 4.104(c)(1) reflects that under Vehicle Code sections 1808.10, 41501, and 42005, the record of a driver with a class A, class B, or commercial class C license who completes a traffic violator school program is not confidential and must be reported to and disclosed by the Department of Motor Vehicles for purposes of Title 49 of the Federal Code of Regulations and to insurers for underwriting and rating purposes.   Subdivision (c)(2).  Rule 4.104(c)(2) reflects court rulings in cases where defendants wished to plead not guilty and have the court order attendance of traffic violator school if found guilty after trial. A court has discretion to grant or not grant traffic violator school. ( People v. Schindler  (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 431, 433; People v. Levinson  (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d Supp. 13, 21.) However, the court may not arbitrarily refuse to consider a request for traffic violator school because a defendant pleads not guilty. ( Schindler,  supra, at p. 433; People v. Wozniak  (1987) 197 Cal.App.3d Supp. 43, 44; People v. Enochs  (1976) 62 Cal.App.3d Supp. 42, 44.) If a judicial officer believes that a defendant\u2019s circumstances indicate that a defendant would benefit from attending school, such attendance should be authorized and should not be affected by the order in which the plea, explanation, and request for traffic violator school are presented. ( Enochs, supra,  at p. 44.) A court is not required to state its reasons for granting or denying traffic violator school following a defendant\u2019s conviction for a traffic violation. ( Schindler, supra,  at p. 433.)  Rule 4.105.  Appearance without deposit of bail in infraction cases  (a) Application  This rule applies to any infraction for which the defendant has received a written notice to appear.  (Subd (a) amended effective December 1, 2015.)  (b) Appearance without deposit of bail  Except as provided in (c), courts must allow a defendant to appear for arraignment and trial without deposit of bail.  (c) Deposit of bail  (1) Courts must require the deposit of bail when the defendant elects a statutory procedure that requires the deposit of bail.   8  (2) Courts may require the deposit of bail when the defendant does not sign a written promise to appear as required by the court.  (3)  Courts may require a deposit of bail before trial if the court determines that the defendant is unlikely to appear as ordered without a deposit of bail and the court expressly states the reasons for the finding.  (4) In determining the amount of bail set under (2) and (3), courts must consider the totality of the circumstances.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2017; previously amended effective December 1, 2015.)  (d) Notice  Courts must inform defendants of the option to appear in court without the deposit of bail in any instructions or other materials courts provide for the public that relate to bail for infractions, including any website information, written instructions, courtesy notices, and forms.  (Subd (d) amended effective December 1, 2015.)  (e) Local Website Information  The website for each trial court must include a link to the traffic self-help information posted at: http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-traffic.htm .  (Subd (e) adopted effective January 1, 2017.)  Rule 4.105 amended effective January 1, 2017; adopted effective June 8, 2015; previously amended December 1, 2015.  Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivision (a).  The rule is intended to apply only to an infraction violation for which the defendant has received a written notice to appear and has appeared by the appearance date or an approved extension of that date. The rule does not apply to postconviction matters or cases in which the defendant seeks an appearance in court after a failure to appear or pay.  Subdivision (c).  This subdivision takes into account the distinct statutory purposes and functions that bail and related considerations serve in infraction cases, including, for example, the posting and forfeiting of bail in uncontested cases and the use of bail to satisfy later judgments, as distinguished from felony and most misdemeanor cases.  Subdivision (c)(1). Various statutory provisions authorize infraction defendants who have received a written notice to appear to elect to deposit bail in lieu of appearing in court or in advance of the notice to appear date. (See, e.g., Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 40510 [authorizing defendants to  9 deposit bail before the notice to appear date]; 40519(a) [authorizing defendants who have received a written notice to appear to declare the intention to plead not guilty and deposit bail before the notice to appear date for purposes of electing to schedule an arraignment and trial on the same date or on separate dates]; 40519(b) [authorizing defendants who have received a written notice to appear to deposit bail and plead not guilty in writing in lieu of appearing in person]; and 40902 [authorizing trial by written declaration].)   This rule is not intended to modify or contravene any statutorily authorized alternatives to appearing in court. (See, e.g., Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 853.5, 853.6; Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 40510, 40512, and 40512.5 [authorizing defendants to post and forfeit bail in lieu of appearing for arraignment].) The purpose of this rule is to clarify that if the defendant declines to use a statutorily authorized alternative, courts must allow the defendant to appear without prior deposit of bail as provided above.  Subdivision (c)(2). As used in this subdivision, the phrase \u201cwritten promise to appear as required by the court\u201d refers to a signed promise, made by a defendant who has appeared in court, to return to court on a future date and time as ordered by the court.  Subdivision (c)(3).  In exercising discretion to require deposit of bail on a particular case, courts should consider, among other factors, whether previous failures to pay or appear were willful or involved adequate notice.    Subdivision (c)(4). In considering the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d under this subdivision, courts may consider whether the bail amount would impose an undue hardship on the defendant.   Rule 4.106.  Failure to appear or failure to pay for a Notice to Appear  issued for an infraction offense  (a) Application  This rule applies to infraction offenses for which the defendant has received a written notice to appear and has failed to appear or failed to pay.  (b) Definitions  As used in this rule, \u201cfailure to appear\u201d and \u201cfailure to pay\u201d mean failure to appear and failure to pay as defined in section 1214.1(a).  (c) Procedure for consideration of good cause for failure to appear or pay  (1) A notice of a civil assessment under section 1214.1(b) must inform the defendant of his or her right to petition that the civil assessment be vacated for good cause and must include information about the process for vacating or reducing the assessment.  (2) When a notice of civil assessment is given, a defendant may, within the time specified in the notice, move by written petition to vacate or reduce the assessment.   10  (3) When a court imposes a civil assessment for failure to appear or pay, the defendant may petition that the court vacate or reduce the civil assessment without paying any bail, fines, penalties, fees, or assessments.    (4) A petition to vacate an assessment does not stay the operation of any order requiring the payment of bail, fines, penalties, fees, or assessment unless specifically ordered by the court.  (5) The court must vacate the assessment upon a showing of good cause under \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
