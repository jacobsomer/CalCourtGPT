The final report is available at www.courts.ca.gov/elkins-finalreport.pdf .

Courts must not adopt local rules that create barriers for self-represented litigants or parties represented by counsel in getting their day in court. Further, courts should not adopt general rules for a courtroom as they pose substantial barriers to a party\u2019s access to justice.
