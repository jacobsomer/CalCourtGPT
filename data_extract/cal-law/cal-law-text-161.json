Advisory Committee Comment  Under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the court may appoint a surrogate parent to speak and act on behalf of a pupil in all matters relating to the identification, evaluation, and educational placement of the child and to the provision of the child\u2019s free, appropriate public education. (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(b)(2); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.519.) Under Welfare and Institutions Code sections 361 and 726, the court must appoint a responsible adult as an educational representative or rights holder to make decisions regarding the child\u2019s educational or developmental-services needs when the parent\u2019s rights to make those decisions have been limited. A court-appointed educational rights holder is responsible for protecting the child\u2019s rights and interests with respect to educational or developmental services, including any special education and related services.  If the court limits the parent\u2019s decisionmaking rights and cannot identify a responsible adult to appoint as educational rights holder, and the appointment of a surrogate parent is not warranted, sections 361 and 726 authorize the court to make educational or developmental-services decisions for the child with the input of interested persons. If, however, the court cannot identify a responsible adult to appoint as educational rights holder and there is reason to believe that the child needs special education and related services, the court must refer the child to the local educational agency (LEA) for the appointment of a surrogate parent. Sections 361 and 726 do not  428 authorize the court to make educational decisions for a child in these circumstances. The surrogate parent appointed by the LEA acts as a parent for the purpose of making decisions with respect to special education and related services and the provision of a free, appropriate public education on behalf of the child. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7579.5(c); Ed. Code, \u00a7 56028; 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.30(b)(2); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401(9), 1414(d).) If, however, the LEA does not appoint a surrogate parent in a timely manner, the court has the authority to join the LEA in the dependency proceedings under section 362 and rule 5.575. In the period between the setting of the joinder hearing and the appointment of a surrogate parent by the LEA, the court may make educational decisions for the child under the general authority granted by section 362(a).
