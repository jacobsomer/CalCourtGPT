Advisory Committee Comment  Juvenile court judicial officers throughout the state have expressed concern that in determining whether or not to transfer a juvenile court case, the best interest of the subject child is being overlooked or at least outweighed by a desire to shift the financial burdens of case management and foster care. The advisory committee has clarified rule 5.610 in order to stress that in considering an intercounty transfer, as in all matters relating to children within its jurisdiction, the court has a mandate to act in the best interest of the subject children.  Juvenile Court Transfer-Out Orders  (form JV-550) was adopted for mandatory use commencing January 1, 1992. Although the finding regarding the best interest of the child was noted on the original form, the language has been emphasized on the amended form.  Rule 5.612.  Transfer-in hearing  (a) Procedure on transfer (\u00a7\u00a7 378, 753)  On receipt and filing of a certified copy of a transfer order, the receiving court must accept jurisdiction of the case. The receiving court may not reject the case. The clerk of the receiving court must confirm the transfer-in hearing date scheduled by the sending court and ensure that date is on the receiving court\u2019s calendar. The receiving court must notify the transferring court on receipt and filing of the certified copies of the transfer order and complete case file.   356 (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2017; repealed and adopted effective January 1, 1990; previously amended effective January 1, 1992, July 1, 1999, January 1, 2004, and January 1, 2007.)  (b) Conduct of hearing  At the transfer-in hearing, the court must:  (1) Advise the child and the parent or guardian of the purpose and scope of the hearing;  (2) Provide for the appointment of counsel if appropriate; and  (3) If the child was transferred to the county in custody, determine whether the child must be further detained under rule 5.667.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2004.)  (c) Subsequent proceedings  The proceedings in the receiving court must commence at the same phase as when the case was transferred. The court may continue the hearing for an investigation and report to a date not to exceed 10 court days if the child is in custody or 15 court days if the child is not detained in custody.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2004; previously amended effective July 1, 1999.)  (d) Limitation on more restrictive custody (\u00a7\u00a7 387, 777)  If a disposition order has already been made in the transferring county, a more restrictive level of physical custody may not be ordered in the receiving county, except after a hearing on a supplemental petition under rule 5.565.

The court may direct the department of social services or the probation department to seek a modification of orders under section 388 or 778 and under rule 5.570.  (Subd (f) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted effective January 1, 1992; previously amended effective July 1, 1999, and January 1, 2004.)  Rule 5.612 amended effective January 1, 2017; adopted as rule 1426 effective January 1, 1990; previously amended effective January 1, 1992, July 1, 1999, and January 1, 2004; previously amended and renumbered as rule 5.612 effective January 1, 2007.  Rule 5.613.  Transfer of nonminor dependents  (a) Purpose  This rule applies to requests to transfer the county of jurisdiction of a nonminor dependent as allowed by Welfare and Institutions Code section 375. This rule sets forth the procedures that a court is to follow when it seeks to order a transfer of a nonminor dependent and those to be followed by the court receiving the transfer. All other intercounty transfers of juveniles are subject to rules 5.610 and 5.612.  (b) Transfer-out hearing  (1) Determination of residence\u2014special rule on intercounty transfers (\u00a7\u00a7 17.1, 375)   (A) For purposes of this rule, the residence of a nonminor dependent who is placed in a planned permanent living arrangement may be either the county in which the court that has jurisdiction over the nonminor is located or the county in which the nonminor has resided continuously for at least one year as a nonminor dependent and the nonminor dependent has expressed his or her intent to remain.  (B) If a nonminor dependent\u2019s dependency jurisdiction has been resumed, or if transition jurisdiction has been assumed or resumed by the juvenile court that retained general jurisdiction over the nonminor under section 303, the county that the nonminor dependent is residing  358 in may be deemed the county of residence of the nonminor dependent. The court may make this determination if the nonminor has established a continuous physical presence in the county for one year as a nonminor and has expressed his or her intent to remain in that county after the court grants the petition to resume jurisdiction. The period of continuous physical presence includes any period of continuous residence immediately before filing the petition.  (2) Verification of residence   The residence of a nonminor may be verified by declaration of a social worker or probation officer in the transferring or receiving county.  (3) Transfer to county of nonminor\u2019s residence (\u00a7 375)  If the court is resuming dependency jurisdiction or assuming or resuming transition jurisdiction of a nonminor for whom the court has retained general jurisdiction under section 303(b) as a result of a petition filed under section 388(e), after granting the petition, the court may order the transfer of the case to the juvenile court of the county in which the nonminor is living if the nonminor establishes residency in that county as provided in (b)(1) and the court finds that the transfer is in the minor\u2019s best interest.  (4) Transfer on change in nonminor\u2019s residence (\u00a7 375)  If a nonminor dependent under the dependency or transition jurisdiction of the court is placed in a planned permanent living arrangement in a county other than the county with jurisdiction over the nonminor, the court may, on an application for modification under rule 5.570, transfer the case to the juvenile court of the county in which the nonminor is living if the nonminor establishes residency in that county as provided in (b)(1).  (5) Conduct of hearing   (A) The request for transfer must be made on Motion for Transfer Out  (form JV-548), which must include all required information.  (B) After the court determines whether a nonminor has established residency in another county as required in (b)(1), the court must consider whether transfer of the case would be in the nonminor\u2019s best interest. The court may not transfer the case unless it determines that the nonminor supports the transfer and that the transfer will protect or further the nonminor\u2019s best interest.  359  (C) If the transfer-out motion is granted, the sending court must set a date certain for the transfer-in hearing in the receiving court, which must be within 10 court days of the transfer-out order. The sending court must state on the record the date, time, and location of the hearing in the receiving court.  (6) Order of transfer (\u00a7 377)   The order of transfer must be entered on Juvenile Court Transfer-Out Orders\u2014Nonminor Dependent  (form JV-552), which must include all required information and findings.  (7) Modification of form JV-552   Juvenile Court Transfer-Out Orders\u2014Nonminor Dependent  (form JV-552) may be modified as follows:  (A) Notwithstanding the mandatory use of form JV-552, the form may be modified for use by a formalized regional collaboration of courts to facilitate the efficient processing of transfer cases among those courts if the modification has been approved by the Judicial Council.  \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
