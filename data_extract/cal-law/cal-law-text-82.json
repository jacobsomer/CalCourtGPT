{"prompt": "(a) Multiple violent sex crimes   When a defendant has been convicted of multiple violent sex offenses as defined in section 667.6, the sentencing judge must determine whether the crimes involved separate victims or the same victim on separate occasions.  (1) Different victims    If the crimes were committed against different victims, a full, separate, and consecutive term must be imposed for a violent sex crime as to each victim, under section 667.6(d).  (2) Same victim, separate occasions   If the crimes were committed against a single victim, the sentencing judge must determine whether the crimes were committed on separate occasions. In determining whether there were separate occasions, the sentencing judge must consider whether, between the commission of one sex crime and  83 another, the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to reflect on his or her actions and nevertheless resumed sexually assaultive behavior. A full, separate, and consecutive term must be imposed for each violent sex offense committed on a separate occasion under section 667.6(d).  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Same victim, same occasion; other crimes   If the defendant has been convicted of multiple crimes, including at least one violent sex crime, as defined in section 667.6, or if there have been multiple violent sex crimes against a single victim on the same occasion and the sentencing court has decided to impose consecutive sentences, the sentencing judge must then determine whether to impose a full, separate, and consecutive sentence under section 667.6(c) for the violent sex crime or crimes instead of including the violent sex crimes in the computation of the principal and subordinate terms under section 1170.1(a). A decision to impose a fully consecutive sentence under section 667.6(c) is an additional sentence choice that requires a statement of reasons separate from those given for consecutive sentences, but which may repeat the same reasons. The sentencing judge is to be guided by the criteria listed in rule 4.425, which incorporates rules 4.421 and 4.423, as well as any other reasonably related criteria as provided in rule 4.408.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective July 1, 2003.)  Rule 4.426 amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as rule 426 effective January 1, 1991; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective July 1, 2003.  Advisory Committee Comment  Section 667.6(d) requires a full, separate, and consecutive term for each of the enumerated violent sex crimes that involve separate victims, or the same victim on separate occasions. Therefore, if there were separate victims or the court found that there were separate occasions, no other reasons are required.  If there have been multiple convictions involving at least one of the enumerated violent sex crimes, the court may impose a full, separate, and consecutive term for each violent sex crime under section 667.6(c). (See People v. Coleman  (1989) 48 Cal.3d 112, 161.) A fully consecutive sentence under section 667.6(c) is a sentence choice, which requires a statement of reasons. The court may not use the same fact to impose a sentence under section 667.6(c) that was used to impose an upper term. (See rule 4.425(b).) If the court selects the upper term, imposes consecutive sentences, and uses section 667.6(c), the record must reflect three sentencing choices with three separate statements of reasons, but the same reason may be used for sentencing under section 667.6(c) and to impose consecutive sentences. (See People v. Belmontes  (1983) 34 Cal.3d 335, 347\u2013349.)   84 Rule 4.427.  Hate crimes  (a) Application  This rule is intended to assist judges in sentencing in felony hate crime cases.  It applies to:  (1) Felony sentencing under section 422.7;  (2) Convictions of felonies with a hate crime enhancement under section 422.75; and   (3) Convictions of felonies that qualify as hate crimes under section 422.55.  (b) Felony sentencing under section 422.7  If one of the three factors listed in section 422.7 is pled and proved, a misdemeanor conviction that constitutes a hate crime under section 422.55 may be sentenced as a felony. The punishment is imprisonment in state prison or county jail under section 1170(h) as provided by section 422.7.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2017.)  (c) Hate crime enhancement    If a hate crime enhancement is pled and proved, the punishment for a felony conviction must be enhanced under section 422.75 unless the conviction is sentenced as a felony under section 422.7.    (1) The following enhancements apply:  (A) An enhancement of a term in state prison as provided in section 422.75(a).  Personal use of a firearm in the commission of the offense is an aggravating factor that must be considered in determining the enhancement term.  (B) An additional enhancement of one year in state prison for each prior felony conviction that constitutes a hate crime as defined in section 422.55.    (2) The court may strike enhancements under (c) if it finds mitigating circumstances under rule 4.423, or pursuant to section 1385(c) and states those mitigating circumstances on the record.  (3) The punishment for any enhancement under (c) is in addition to any other punishment provided by law.   85 (Subd (c) amended effective March 14, 2022.  (d) Hate crime as aggravating factor    If the defendant is convicted of a felony, and the facts of the crime constitute a hate crime under section 422.55, that fact must be considered a circumstance in aggravation in determining the appropriate punishment under rule 4.421 unless:  (1) The court imposed a hate crime enhancement under section 422.75; or  (2) The defendant has been convicted of an offense subject to sentencing under section 1170.8.  (e) Hate crime sentencing goals   When sentencing a defendant under this rule, the judge must consider the principal goals for hate crime sentencing.    (1) The principal goals for hate crime sentencing, as stated in section 422.86, are:  (A) Punishment for the hate crime committed;  (B) Crime and violence prevention, including prevention of recidivism and prevention of crimes and violence in prisons and jails; and   (C) Restorative justice for the immediate victims of the hate crimes and for the classes of persons terrorized by the hate crimes.   (2) Crime and violence prevention considerations should include educational or other appropriate programs available in the community, jail, prison, and juvenile detention facilities.  The programs should address sensitivity or similar training or counseling intended to reduce violent and antisocial behavior based on one or more of the following actual or perceived characteristics of the victim:  (A) Disability;  (B) Gender;   (C) Nationality;  (D) Race or ethnicity;  (E) Religion;  (F) Sexual orientation; or   86 (G) Association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics.   (3) Restorative justice considerations should include community service and other programs focused on hate crime prevention or diversity sensitivity.  Additionally, the court should consider ordering payment or other compensation to programs that provide services to violent crime victims and reimbursement to the victim for reasonable costs of counseling and other reasonable expenses that the court finds are a direct result of the defendant\u2019s actions.  Rule 4.427 amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted effective January 1, 2007: previously amended effective January 1, 2017.  Advisory Committee Comment  Multiple enhancements for prior convictions under subdivision (c)(1)(B) may be imposed if the prior convictions have been brought and tried separately.  (Pen. Code, \u00a7 422.75(d).  In order to impose the upper term based on section 422.75, the fact of the enhancement pursuant to sections 422.55 or 422.6 must be stipulated to by the defendant or found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by the jury or the judge in a court trial.  Any enhancement alleged pursuant to this section may be dismissed pursuant to section 1385(c).   Rule 4.428. Factors affecting imposition of enhancements  (a) Enhancements punishable by one of three terms  If an enhancement is punishable by one of three terms, the court must, in its sound discretion, order imposition of a sentence not to exceed the middle term, unless there are circumstances in aggravation that justify the imposition of a term of imprisonment exceeding the middle term, and the facts underlying those circumstances have been stipulated to by the defendant, or have been found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by the jury or by the judge in a court trial.   (Subd (a) amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted effective January 1, 2018.)  (b) Striking or dismissing enhancements under section 1385  If the court has discretion under section 1385(a) to strike an enhancement in the interests of justice, the court also has the authority to strike the punishment for the enhancement under section 1385(b). In determining whether to strike the entire enhancement or only the punishment for the enhancement, the court may consider the effect that striking the enhancement would have on the status of the crime as a strike, the accurate reflection of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct on his or her  87 record, the effect it may have on the award of custody credits, and any other relevant consideration.  (Subd (b) amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted effective January 1, 2018.)  (c) Dismissing enhancements under section 1385(c)    (1) The court shall exercise the discretion to dismiss an enhancement if it is in the furtherance of justice to do so, unless the dismissal is prohibited by initiative statute.  (2) In exercising its discretion under section 1385(c), the court must consider and afford great weight to evidence offered by the defendant to prove that any of the mitigating circumstances in section 1385(c) are present.   (A)  Proof of the presence of one or more of these circumstances weighs greatly in favor of dismissing the enhancement, unless the court finds that dismissal of the enhancement would endanger public safety.   (B) The circumstances listed in 1385(c) are not exclusive.  (C) \u201cEndanger public safety\u201d means there is a likelihood that the dismissal of the enhancement would result in physical injury or other serious danger to others.  (3) If the court dismisses the enhancement pursuant to 1385(c), then both the enhancement and its punishment must be dismissed.  (Subd (c) adopted effective March 14, 2022.) Rule 4.428 amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted as rule 428 effective January 1, 1991; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 1998, July 1, 2003, January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, January 1, 2008, January 1, 2011, and January 18, 2022.  Advisory Committee Comment  Case law suggests that in determining the \u201cfurtherance of justice\u201d the court should consider the constitutional rights of the defendant and the interests of society represented by the people; the defendant\u2019s background and prospects, including the presence or absence of a record; the nature and circumstances of the crime and the defendant\u2019s level of involvement; the factors in aggravation and mitigation including the specific factors in mitigation of section 1385(c); and the \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
