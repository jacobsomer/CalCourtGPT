{"prompt": "January 1, 2013.  Advisory Committee Comment  Urgency of ICPC Matters. Implementation of the ICPC has long frustrated judicial officers and other professionals. The overriding concern is that the process takes too long, and children cannot wait. In all ICPC actions, there should be a sense of urgency, and all professionals involved should take action as quickly as possible.  Subdivision (h)(7).  Judicial officers requesting assistance under subdivision (h)(7) from the receiving state judge or judicial officer should be cognizant of ethical concerns raised by such ex parte communication. These concerns can be addressed in various ways, including but not limited to using form JV-565, obtaining a stipulation from all parties to permit judge-to-judge phone or e-mail contact, or conducting the discussion by phone with parties and a court reporter present.  Validity of California Placements in Receiving Jurisdictions.  When a California child is placed with an out-of-state parent, and the placement is consistent with California law, the receiving jurisdiction may consider the placement invalid if it does not comply with the law of the receiving jurisdiction. In this situation, the receiving jurisdiction would have no obligation to provide services.  Regulations and Forms.
