{"prompt": " (C) The following circumstances, standing alone, do not necessarily demonstrate an actual conflict of interest or a reasonable likelihood that an actual conflict of interest will arise:  (i) The siblings are of different ages;  (ii) The siblings have different parents;  (iii) There is a purely theoretical or abstract conflict of interest among the siblings;  (iv) Some of the siblings appear more likely than others to be adoptable; or  (v) The siblings may have different permanent plans.  (2) Withdrawal from appointment or continued representation  (A) An attorney representing a group of siblings has an ongoing duty to evaluate the interests of each sibling and assess whether there is an actual conflict of interest.  (B) The following circumstances, standing alone, do not necessarily demonstrate an actual conflict of interest:  (i) The siblings are of different ages;  (ii) The siblings have different parents;  (iii) There is a purely theoretical or abstract conflict of interest among the siblings;  (iv) Some of the siblings are more likely to be adopted than others;  452  (v) The siblings have different permanent plans;  (vi) The siblings express conflicting desires or objectives, but the issues involved are not material to the case; or  (vii) The siblings give different or contradictory accounts of the events, but the issues involved are not material to the case.  (C) It is not necessary for an attorney to withdraw from representing some or all of the siblings if there is merely a reasonable likelihood that an actual conflict of interest will develop.  (D) If an attorney believes that an actual conflict of interest existed at appointment or developed during representation, the attorney must take any action necessary to ensure that the siblings\u2019 interests are not prejudiced, including:  (i) Notifying the juvenile court of the existence of an actual conflict of interest among some or all of the siblings; and  (ii) Requesting to withdraw from representation of some or all of the siblings.  (E) If the court determines that an actual conflict of interest exists, the court must relieve an attorney from representation of some or all of the siblings.  (F) After an actual conflict of interest arises, the attorney may continue to represent one or more siblings whose interests do not conflict only if:  (i) The attorney has successfully withdrawn from the representation of all siblings whose interests conflict with those of the sibling or siblings the attorney continues to represent;  (ii) The attorney has exchanged no confidential information with any sibling whose interest conflicts with those of the sibling or siblings the attorney continues to represent; and  (iii) Continued representation of one or more siblings would not otherwise prejudice the other sibling or siblings.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted effective January 1, 2006.)  453  (d) Competent counsel  Every party in a dependency proceeding who is represented by an attorney is entitled to competent counsel.  (1) Definition   \u201cCompetent counsel\u201d means an attorney who is a member in good standing of the State Bar of California, who has participated in training in the law of juvenile dependency, and who demonstrates adequate forensic skills, knowledge and comprehension of the statutory scheme, the purposes and goals of dependency proceedings, the specific statutes, rules of court, and cases relevant to such proceedings, and procedures for filing petitions for extraordinary writs.  (2) Evidence of competency   The court may require evidence of the competency of any attorney appointed to represent a party in a dependency proceeding.  (3) Experience and education  (A) Only those attorneys who have completed a minimum of eight hours of training or education in the area of juvenile dependency, or who have sufficient recent experience in dependency proceedings in which the attorney has demonstrated competency, may be appointed to represent parties. Attorney training must include:  (i) An overview of dependency law and related statutes and cases;  (ii) Information on child development, child abuse and neglect, substance abuse, domestic violence, family reunification and preservation, and reasonable efforts; and  (iii) For any attorney appointed to represent a child, instruction on cultural competency and sensitivity relating to, and best practices for, providing adequate care to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth in out-of-home placement.  (B) Within every three years, attorneys must complete at least eight hours of continuing education related to dependency proceedings.    454 (4) Standards of representation   Attorneys or their agents are expected to meet regularly with clients, including clients who are children, regardless of the age of the child or the child\u2019s ability to communicate verbally, to contact social workers and other professionals associated with the client\u2019s case, to work with other counsel and the court to resolve disputed aspects of a case without contested hearing, and to adhere to the mandated timelines. The attorney for the child must have sufficient contact with the child to establish and maintain an adequate and professional attorney-client relationship. The attorney for the child is not required to assume the responsibilities of a social worker and is not expected to perform services for the child that are unrelated to the child\u2019s legal representation.  (5) Attorney contact information   The attorney for a child for whom a dependency petition has been filed must provide his or her contact information to the child\u2019s caregiver no later than 10 days after receipt of the name, address, and telephone number of the child\u2019s caregiver. If the child is 10 years of age or older, the attorney must also provide his or her contact information to the child for whom a dependency petition has been filed no later than 10 days after receipt of the caregiver\u2019s contact information. The attorney may give contact information to a child for whom a dependency petition has been filed who is under 10 years of age. At least once a year, if the list of educational liaisons is available online from the California Department of Education, the child\u2019s attorney must provide, in any manner permitted by section 317(e)(4), his or her contact information to the educational liaison of each local educational agency serving the attorney\u2019s clients in foster care in the county of jurisdiction.  (6) Caseloads for children\u2019s attorneys   The attorney for a child must have a caseload that allows the attorney to perform the duties required by section 317(e) and this rule, and to otherwise adequately counsel and represent the child. To enhance the quality of representation afforded to children, attorneys appointed under this rule must not maintain a maximum full-time caseload that is greater than that which allows them to meet the requirements stated in (3), (4), and (5).  (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2015; adopted as subd (b); amended and relettered as subd (c) effective July 1, 2001; previously relettered effective January 1, 2006; previously amended effective July 1, 1999, January 1, 2005, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2014.)  455  (e) Client complaints  The court must establish a process for the review and resolution of complaints or questions by a party regarding the performance of an appointed attorney. Each party must be informed of the procedure for lodging the complaint. If it is determined that an appointed attorney has acted improperly or contrary to the rules or policies of the court, the court must take appropriate action.  (Subd (e) relettered effective January 1, 2006; adopted as subd (c); previously amended and relettered as subd (d) effective July 1, 2001.)  (f) CASA volunteer as CAPTA guardian ad litem (\u00a7 326.5)  If the court makes the findings as outlined in (b) and does not appoint an attorney to represent the child, the court must appoint a CASA volunteer as the CAPTA guardian ad litem of the child.  (1) The required training of CASA volunteers is stated in rule 5.655.  (2) The caseload of a CASA volunteer acting as a CAPTA guardian ad litem must be limited to 10 cases. A case may include siblings, absent a conflict.  (3) CASA volunteers must not assume the responsibilities of attorneys for children.  (4) The appointment of an attorney to represent the child does not prevent the appointment of a CASA volunteer for that child, and courts are encouraged to appoint both an attorney and a CASA volunteer for the child in as many cases as possible.  (Subd (f) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as subd (e) effective July 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2003; previously relettered effective January 1, 2006.)  (g) Interests of the child  At any time following the filing of a petition under section 300 and until juvenile court jurisdiction is terminated, any interested person may advise the court of information regarding an interest or right of the child to be protected or pursued in other judicial or administrative forums.    456 (1) Juvenile Dependency Petition (Version One) (form JV-100) and Request to Change Court Order  (form JV-180) may be used.  (2) If the attorney for the child, or a CASA volunteer acting as a CAPTA guardian ad litem, learns of any such interest or right, the attorney or CASA volunteer must notify the court immediately and seek instructions from the court as to any appropriate procedures to follow.  (3) If the court determines that further action on behalf of the child is required to protect or pursue any interests or rights, the court must appoint an attorney for the child, if the child is not already represented by counsel, and do one or all of the following:  (A) Refer the matter to the appropriate agency for further investigation and require a report to the court within a reasonable time;  (B) Authorize and direct the child\u2019s attorney to initiate and pursue appropriate action;  (C) Appoint a guardian ad litem for the child. The guardian may be the CASA volunteer already appointed as a CAPTA guardian ad litem or a person who will act only if required to initiate appropriate action; or  (D) Take any other action to protect or pursue the interests and rights of the child.

Rule 5.660 amended effective January 1, 2015; adopted as rule 1438 effective January 1, 1996; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective July 1, 1999, July 1, 2001, January 1, 2003, January 1, 2005, January 1, 2006, and January 1, 2014.  Advisory Committee Comment  The court should initially appoint a single attorney to represent all siblings in a dependency matter unless there is an actual conflict of interest or a reasonable likelihood that an actual conflict of interest will arise. ( In re Celine R. (2003) 31 Cal.4th 45, 58.) After the initial appointment, the court should relieve an attorney from representation of multiple siblings only if an actual conflict of interest arises. ( Ibid.)
