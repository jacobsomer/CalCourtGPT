If so, the court must issue an order to show cause.  (2) On issuing an order to show cause, the court must appoint counsel for any unrepresented petitioner who desires but cannot afford counsel.    112 (3) An order to show cause is a determination that the petitioner has made a showing that he or she may be entitled to relief.
