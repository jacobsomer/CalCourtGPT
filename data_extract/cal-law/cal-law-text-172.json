(2) If the court finds that the social worker has not exercised due diligence, the court may order the social worker to exercise due diligence in conducting an investigation to identify, locate, and notify the child\u2019s relatives\u2014except for any individual the social worker identifies as inappropriate to notify under rule 5.637(b)\u2014and may require a written or oral report to the court.  488  (Subd (e) amended and relettered effective January 1, 2017; adopted as subd (f) effective January 1, 2011; previously amended effective January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2015.)

(2) On a finding and declaration of paternity by the juvenile court or proof of a prior declaration of paternity by any court of competent jurisdiction, the juvenile court may order services for the child and the biological father, if the court determines that such services will benefit the child.  489  (3) If a child is removed from the custody of a parent or guardian, and reunification services are ordered, the court must order visitation between the child and the parent or guardian for whom services are ordered. Visits are to be as frequent as possible, consistent with the well-being of the child.  (4) Reunification services must not be provided when the parent has voluntarily relinquished the child and the relinquishment has been filed with the State Department of Social Services, or if the court has appointed a guardian under section 360.  (5) Except when the order is made under paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of section 361.5, if the court orders no reunification services for every parent otherwise eligible for such services, the court must conduct a hearing under section 366.26 within 120 days and:  (A) Order that the social worker provide a copy of the child\u2019s birth certificate to the caregiver consistent with sections 16010.4(e)(5) and 16010.5(b)\u2013(c); and  (B) Order that the social worker provide a child or youth 16 years of age or older with a certified copy of his or her birth certificate unless the court finds that provision of the birth certificate would be inappropriate.  (6) A judgment, order, or decree setting a hearing under section 366.26 is not an immediately appealable order. Review may be sought only by filing a Notice of Intent to File Writ Petition and Request for Record (California Rules of Court, Rule 8.450)  (form JV-820) or other notice of intent to file a writ petition and request for record, and a Petition for Extraordinary Writ (California Rules of Court, Rules 8.452, 8.456)  (form JV-825) or other petition for extraordinary writ. If a party wishes to preserve any right to review on appeal of the findings and orders made under this rule, the party must seek an extraordinary writ under rules 8.450 and 8.452.  (7) A judgment, order, or decree setting a hearing under section 366.26 may be reviewed on appeal following the order of the 366.26 hearing only if the following have occurred:  (A) An extraordinary writ was sought by the timely filing of a Notice of Intent to File Writ Petition and Request for Record (California Rules of Court, Rule 8.450)  (form JV-820) or other notice of intent to file a writ petition and request for record, and a Petition for Extraordinary Writ  490 (California Rules of Court, Rules 8.452, 8.456)  (form JV-825) or other petition for extraordinary writ; and  (B) The petition for extraordinary writ was summarily denied or otherwise not decided on the merits.  (8) Review on appeal of the order setting a hearing under section 366.26 is limited to issues raised in a previous petition for extraordinary writ that were supported by an adequate record.  (9) Failure to file a notice of intent to file a writ petition and request for record and a petition for extraordinary writ review within the period specified by rules 8.450 and 8.452 to substantively address the issues challenged, or to support the challenge by an adequate record, precludes subsequent review on appeal of the findings and orders made under this rule.  (10) When the court orders a hearing under section 366.26, the court must advise orally all parties present, and by first-class mail or by electronic service in accordance with section 212.5  for parties not present, that if the party wishes to preserve any right to review on appeal of the order setting the hearing under section 366.26, the party must seek an extraordinary writ by filing a Notice of Intent to File Writ Petition and Request for Record (California Rules of Court, Rule 8.450)  (form JV-820) or other notice of intent to file a writ petition and request for record and a Petition for Extraordinary Writ (California Rules of Court, Rules 8.452, 8.456)  (form JV-825) or other petition for extraordinary writ.  (A) Within 24 hours of the hearing, notice by first-class mail or by electronic service in accordance with section 212.5 must be provided by the clerk of the court to the last known address of any party who is not present when the court orders the hearing under section 366.26.  (B) Copies of Petition for Extraordinary Writ (California Rules of Court, Rules 8.452, 8.456)  (form JV-825) and Notice of Intent to File Writ Petition and Request for Record (California Rules of Court, Rule 8.450) (form JV-820) must be available in the courtroom and must accompany all mailed notices informing the parties of their rights.  (C) If the notice is for a hearing at which the social worker will recommend the termination of parental rights, the notice may be electronically served in accordance with section 212.5, but only in addition to service of the notice by first-class mail.   491 (Subd (g) amended effective January 1, 2019; adopted as subd (e); previously relettered as subd (f) effective July 1, 1995, and as subd (h) January 1, 2011; previously amended and relettered effective January 1, 2017; previously amended effective January 1, 1993, July 1, 1993, January 1, 1994, January 1, 1995, January 1, 1996, July 1, 1997, January 1, 1999, July 1, 1999, January 1, 2001, July 1, 2001, July 1, 2002, January 1, 2007, January 1, 2010, January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2015.)
