If the request is made orally, the court must document the request and make it part of the record.   225 (2) Upon receipt of a transfer petition, the state court must ensure that the tribal court is promptly notified in writing of the transfer petition. This notification may request a timely response regarding whether the tribal court wishes to decline the transfer.  (Subd (C) amended effective January 1, 2020.)  (d) Cause to deny a request to transfer to tribal court with concurrent state and tribal jurisdiction  (1) Either of the following circumstances constitutes mandatory good cause to deny a request to transfer:  (A) One or both of the child\u2019s parents objects to the transfer in open court or in an admissible writing for the record; or  (B) The tribal court of the child\u2019s tribe declines the transfer.
