(b) References to \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts\u201d  The Judicial Council in the past referred to its staff as the \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts\u201d. The following applies where the term \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts\u201d is used:  (1) Rules of Court   Throughout these rules of court and in all Judicial Council forms, all references to \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts\u201d or \u201cAOC\u201d are deemed to refer to the Judicial Council, the Administrative Director, or the Judicial Council staff, as appropriate.   (2) Other Judicial Council materials and actions   All references to \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts\u201d or \u201cAOC\u201d in any policy, procedure, manual, guideline, publication, or other material issued by the Judicial Council or its staff are deemed to refer to the Judicial Council, the Administrative Director, or the Judicial Council staff, as appropriate. Judicial Council staff will continue to be responsible for any active delegations or directives the Judicial Council made to the Administrative Office of the Court.

The Judicial Council may be substituted for the \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts\u201d or \u201cAOC\u201d wherever necessary, with no prejudice to the substantive rights of any party.   (Subd (b) amended effective July 29, 2014; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)   78 Rule 10.81 amended effective July 29, 2014; adopted as rule 6.81 effective January 1, 1999; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective August 14, 2009.  Advisory Committee Comment  The Judicial Council in 1961 adopted a resolution that named its staff the \u201cAdministrative Office of the California Courts.\u201d In 1970, the council adopted a rule of court that renamed its staff the \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts.\u201d  In recent years, the council became aware of recurring confusion about the relationship between the Administrative Office of the Courts and the Judicial Council. There was a common misperception that the Administrative Office of the Courts was a separate entity from the council having independent policymaking authority, when in fact, the members of the Judicial Council set policy, and staff, by whatever name, support the work of the council under the members\u2019 direction and oversight. The confusion about the role of the Administrative Office of the Courts impeded the council\u2019s ability to advance the interests of the judicial branch.   To allow the council to better achieve its mission, it decided in 2014 to retire the name \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts.\u201d This adjustment underscored the unity of identity of the Judicial Council and its staff, and clarified that there has always been only a single entity. The retirement conformed the Judicial Council\u2019s practice with that of other state government entities, which do not assign a separate name to their staffs.   The 2014 amendments to this rule are intended to implement the retirement of the name \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts\u201d and clarify that in retiring the name no substantive legal change has occurred. The Judicial Council and its staff will continue to discharge any legal obligations and duties they may have, regardless of the discontinuance of the use of the name \u201cAdministrative Office of the Courts.\u201d   Division 2.
