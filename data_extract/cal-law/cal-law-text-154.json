Parentage  (a) Authority to declare; duty to inquire (\u00a7 316.2, 726.4)  The juvenile court has a duty to inquire about and to attempt to determine the parentage of each child who is the subject of a petition filed under section 300, 601, or 602. The court may establish and enter a judgment of parentage under the Uniform Parentage Act. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7600 et seq.) Once a petition has been filed to declare a child a dependent or ward, and until the petition is dismissed or dependency or wardship is terminated, the juvenile court with jurisdiction over the action has exclusive jurisdiction to hear an action filed under Family Code section 7630.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2015; previously amended effective January 1, 2001, January 1, 2006, and January 1, 2007.)  (b) Parentage inquiry (\u00a7\u00a7 316.2, 726.4)  At the initial hearing on a petition filed under section 300 or at the dispositional hearing on a petition filed under section 601 or 602, and at hearings thereafter until or unless parentage has been established, the court must inquire of the child\u2019s parents present at the hearing and of any other appropriate person present as to the identity and address of any and all presumed or alleged parents of the child. Questions, at the discretion of the court, may include the following and others that may provide information regarding parentage:   386 (1) Has there been a judgment of parentage?  (2) Was the mother married or did she have a registered domestic partner at or after the time of conception?  (3) Did the mother believe she was married or believe she had a registered domestic partner at or after the time of conception?  (4) Was the mother cohabiting with another adult at the time of conception?  (5) Has the mother received support payments or promises of support for the child or for herself during her pregnancy or after the birth of the child?  (6) Has a man formally or informally acknowledged parentage, including the execution and filing of a voluntary declaration of parentage or paternity under Family Code section 7570 et seq., and agreed to have his name placed on the child\u2019s birth certificate?  (7) Has genetic testing been administered, and, if so, what were the results?  (8) Has the child been raised jointly with another adult or in any other co-parenting arrangement?  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2020; adopted effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2006, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2015.)  (c) Voluntary declaration  If a voluntary declaration as described in Family Code section 7570 et seq. has been executed and filed with the California Department of Child Support Services, the declaration establishes the parentage of a child and has the same force and effect as a judgment of parentage by a court. A person is presumed to be the parent of the child under Family Code section 7611 if the voluntary declaration has been properly executed and filed.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2020; adopted effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2006, July 1, 2006, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2015.)  (d) Issue raised; inquiry  If, at any proceeding regarding the child, the issue of parentage is addressed by the court:  387  (1) The court must ask the parent or the person alleging parentage, and others present, whether any parentage finding has been made, and, if so, what court made it, or whether a voluntary declaration has been executed and filed under the Family Code;  (2) The court must direct the court clerk to prepare and transmit Parentage Inquiry\u2014Juvenile  (form JV-500) to the local child support agency requesting an inquiry regarding whether parentage has been established through any superior court order or judgment or through the execution and filing of a voluntary declaration under the Family Code;  (3) The office of child support enforcement must prepare and return the completed Parentage Inquiry\u2014Juvenile  (form JV-500) within 25 judicial days, with certified copies of any such order or judgment or proof of the filing of any voluntary declaration attached; and  (4) The juvenile court must take judicial notice of the prior determination of parentage.  (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2015; adopted as subd (b); previously amended and relettered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2006, and January 1, 2007.)  (e) No prior determination  If the local child support agency states, or if the court determines through statements of the parties or other evidence, that there has been no prior determination of parentage of the child, the juvenile court must take appropriate steps to make such a determination.  (1) Any alleged father and his counsel must complete and submit Statement Regarding Parentage (Juvenile) (form JV-505). Form JV-505 must be made available in the courtroom.  (2) To determine parentage, the juvenile court may order the child and any alleged parents to submit to genetic tests and proceed under Family Code section 7550 et seq.  (3) The court may make its determination of parentage or nonparentage based on the testimony, declarations, or statements of the alleged parents. The court must advise any alleged parent that if parentage is determined, the parent will have responsibility for the financial support of the child, and, if the child  388 receives welfare benefits, the parent may be subject to an action to obtain support payments.  (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2015; adopted as subd (c); previously amended and relettered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2006, and January 1, 2007.)  (f) Notice to office of child support enforcement  If the court establishes parentage of the child, the court must sign Parentage\u2014Finding and Judgment (Juvenile) (form JV-501) and direct the clerk to transmit the signed form to the local child support agency.  \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
