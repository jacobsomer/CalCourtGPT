{"prompt": "imposition of the low term when the court finds that certain factors contributed to the commission of the crime unless the court finds that it would not be in the interests of justice to do so because the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170(b)(6).)   Rule 4.406.  Reasons  (a) How given   If the sentencing judge is required to give reasons for a sentence choice, the judge must state in simple language the primary factor or factors that support the exercise of discretion. The statement need not be in the language of the statute or these rules. It must be delivered orally on the record. The court may give a single statement explaining the reason or reasons for imposing a particular sentence or the exercise of judicial discretion, if the statement identifies the sentencing choices where discretion is exercised and there is no impermissible dual use of facts.  57  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) When reasons required  Sentence choices that generally require a statement of a reason include, but are not limited to:  (1) Granting probation when the defendant is presumptively ineligible for probation;  (2) Denying probation when the defendant is presumptively eligible for probation;  (3) Selecting a term for either an offense or an enhancement;  (4) Imposing consecutive sentences;  (5) Imposing full consecutive sentences under section 667.6(c) rather than consecutive terms under section 1170.1(a), when the court has that choice;  (6) Waiving a restitution fine;  (7) Granting relief under section 1385; and  (8) Denying mandatory supervision in the interests of justice under section 1170(h)(5)(A).  (Subd (b) amended and renumbered effective March 14, 2022; previously amended effective January 1, 2001, July 1, 2003, January 1, 2006, January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, and January 1, 2017; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2018.)  Rule 4.406 amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted as rule 406 effective January 1, 1991; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective July 1, 2003, January 1, 2006, January 1, 2007, May 23, 2007, January 1, 2017, and January 1, 2018.   Advisory Committee Comment  This rule is not intended to expand the statutory requirements for giving reasons, and is not an independent interpretation of the statutory requirements.  The court is not required to separately state the reasons for making each sentencing choice so long as the record reflects the court understood it had discretion on a particular issue and its reasons for making the particular choice. For example, if the court decides to deny probation and  58 impose the upper term of punishment, the court may simply state: \u201cI am denying probation and imposing the upper term because of the extensive losses to the victim and because the defendant\u2019s record is increasing in seriousness.\u201d It is not necessary to state a reason after exercising each decision.  The court must be mindful of impermissible dual use of facts in stating reasons for sentencing choices. For example, the court is not permitted to use a reason to impose a greater term if that reason also is either (1) the same as an enhancement that will be imposed, or (2) an element of the crime. The court should not use the same reason to impose a consecutive sentence and to impose an upper term of imprisonment. ( People v. Avalos  (1984) 37 Cal.3d 216, 233.) It is not improper to use the same reason to deny probation and to impose the upper term. ( People v. Bowen  (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 102, 106.)  Whenever relief is granted under section 1385, the court\u2019s reasons for exercising that discretion must be stated orally on the record and entered in the minutes if requested by a party or if the proceedings are not recorded electronically or reported by a court reporter. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1385(a).) Although no legal authority requires the court to state reasons for denying relief, such a statement may be helpful in the appellate review of the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion.   Rule 4.408.  Listing of factors not exclusive; sequence not significant  (a) The listing of factors in these rules for making discretionary sentencing decisions is not exhaustive and does not prohibit a trial judge from using additional criteria reasonably related to the decision being made. Any such additional criteria must be stated on the record by the sentencing judge.   (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) The order in which criteria are listed does not indicate their relative weight or importance.   Rule 4.408 amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted as rule 408 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.  Advisory Committee Comment  The variety of circumstances presented in felony cases is so great that no listing of criteria could claim to be all-inclusive. (Cf., Evid. Code, \u00a7 351.)  The court may impose a sentence or enhancement exceeding the middle term only if the facts underlying the aggravating factor were stipulated to by the defendant or found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by the jury or by the judge in a court trial. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170(b)(2).)  However, in determining whether to impose the upper term for a criminal offense, the court may consider as an aggravating factor that a defendant has suffered one or more prior convictions, based on certified records of conviction. This exception may not be used to select the upper term of an enhancement. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170(b)(3).)  59  The Legislature also amended the determinate sentencing law to require courts to order imposition of the low term when the court finds that certain factors contributed to the commission of the crime unless the court finds that it would not be in the interests of justice to do so because the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170(b)(6).)    Rule 4.409. Consideration of relevant factors  Relevant factors enumerated in these rules must be considered by the sentencing judge, and will be deemed to have been considered unless the record affirmatively reflects otherwise.  Rule 4.409 amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted as rule 409 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.  Advisory Committee Comment  Relevant factors are those applicable to the facts in the record of the case; not all factors will be relevant to each case. The judge\u2019s duty is similar to the duty to consider the probation officer\u2019s report. Section 1203.  In deeming the sentencing judge to have considered relevant factors, the rule applies the presumption of Evidence Code section 664 that official duty has been regularly performed. (See People v. Moran  (1970) 1 Cal.3d 755, 762 [trial court presumed to have considered referring eligible defendant to California Youth Authority in absence of any showing to the contrary, citing Evidence Code section 664].)  Rule 4.410.  General objectives in sentencing  (a) General objectives of sentencing include:  (1) Protecting society;  (2) Punishing the defendant;  (3) Encouraging the defendant to lead a law-abiding life in the future and deterring him or her from future offenses;  (4) Deterring others from criminal conduct by demonstrating its consequences;  (5) Preventing the defendant from committing new crimes by isolating him or her for the period of incarceration;  (6) Securing restitution for the victims of crime;   (7) Achieving uniformity in sentencing; and  60  (8) Increasing public safety by reducing recidivism through community-based corrections programs and evidence-based practices.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2017; previously amended effective July 1, 2003, ad January 1, 2007.)  (b) Because in some instances these objectives may suggest inconsistent dispositions, the sentencing judge must consider which objectives are of primary importance in the particular case. The sentencing judge should be guided by statutory statements of policy, the criteria in these rules, and any other facts and circumstances relevant to the case.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously lettered effective July 1, 2003; adopted as part of unlettered subd effective July 1, 1977; former subd (b) amended and relettered as part of subd (a) effective July 1, 2003.)  Rule 4.410 amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted as rule 410 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective July 1, 2003, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2017.  Advisory Committee Comment  Statutory expressions of policy include:  Section 1170(a)(1), which expresses the policies of uniformity, proportionality of terms of imprisonment to the seriousness of the offense, and the use of imprisonment as punishment. It also states that \u201cthe purpose of sentencing is public safety achieved through punishment, rehabilitation, and restorative justice.\u201d  Sections 17.5, 1228, and 3450, which express the policies promoting reinvestment of criminal justice resources to support community-based corrections programs and evidence-based practices to improve public safety through a reduction in recidivism.   Rule 4.411.  Presentence investigations and reports  (a) When required  As provided in subdivision (b), the court must refer the case to the probation officer for:  (1) A presentence investigation and report if the defendant:  (A) Is statutorily eligible for probation or a term of imprisonment in county jail under section 1170(h); or   61 (B) Is not eligible for probation but a report is needed to assist the court with other sentencing issues, including the determination of the proper amount of restitution fine;  (2) A supplemental report if a significant period of time has passed since the original report was prepared.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective January 1, 2007, and January 15, 2015.)  (b) Waiver of the investigation and report  The parties may stipulate to the waiver of the probation officer\u2019s investigation and report in writing or in open court and entered in the minutes, and with the consent of the court. In deciding whether to consent to the waiver, the court should consider whether the information in the report would assist in the resolution of any current or future sentencing issues, or would assist in the effective supervision of the person. A waiver under this section does not affect the requirement under section 1203c that a probation report be created when the court commits a person to state prison.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective January 1, 2015.)  Rule 4.411 amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted as rule 418 effective July 1, 1977; previously amended and renumbered as rule 411 effective January 1, 1991; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2006, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2015.  Advisory Committee Comment  Section 1203 requires a presentence report in every felony case in which the defendant is eligible for probation. Subdivision (a) requires a presentence report in every felony case in which the defendant is eligible for a term of imprisonment in county jail under section 1170(h).
