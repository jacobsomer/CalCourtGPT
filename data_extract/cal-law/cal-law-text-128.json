{"prompt": "knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived them. Any such stipulation must be agreed to in writing.  (3) Failure to meet non-Indian family and child-rearing community standards, or the existence of other behavior or conditions that meet the removal standards of Welfare and Institutions Code section 361, will not support an order for placement absent the finding that continued custody with the parent or Indian custodian is likely to cause serious emotional or physical damage.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2013.)  (b) Standards and preferences in placement of an Indian child  (1) All placements of an Indian child must be in the least restrictive setting that most approximates a family situation and in which the child\u2019s special needs, if any, may be met.  (2) Unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that there is good cause to deviate from them, whenever it is known or there is reason to know the child is an Indian child, all placement in any proceeding listed in rules 5.480 and 5.484 must follow the specified placement preferences in Family Code section 177(a), Probate Code section 1459(b), and Welfare and Institutions Code section 361.31.  (3) The court must analyze the availability of placements within the placement preferences in descending order without skipping. The court may deviate from the preference order only for good cause, which may include the following considerations:  (A) The requests of the parent or Indian custodian if they attest that they have reviewed the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of preference;  (B) The requests of the Indian child, when of sufficient age and capacity to understand the decision being made;  (C) The presence of a sibling attachment that can be maintained only through a particular placement;  (D) The extraordinary physical, mental, or emotional needs of the Indian child, including specialized treatment services that may be unavailable  232 in the community where families who meet the placement preferences live; or  (E) The unavailability of a suitable placement within the placement preferences based on a documented diligent effort to identify placements meeting the preference criteria. The standard for determining whether a placement is unavailable must conform to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the Indian child\u2019s parent or extended family resides or with which the Indian child\u2019s parent or extended family members maintain social and cultural ties.  (4) The placement preferences must be analyzed and considered each time there is a change in the child\u2019s placement. A finding that there is good cause to deviate from the placement preferences does not affect the requirement that a diligent search be made for a subsequent placement within the placement preferences.  (5) The burden of establishing good cause for the court to deviate from the preference order is on the party requesting that the preference order not be followed. A placement may not depart from the preferences based on the socioeconomic status of any placement relative to another or solely on the basis of ordinary bonding or attachment that flowed from time spent in a nonpreferred placement that was made in violation of the Indian Child Welfare Act.   (6) The tribe, by resolution, may establish a different preference order, which must be followed if it provides for the least restrictive setting.  (7) The preferences and wishes of the Indian child, when of sufficient age, and the parent must be considered, and weight given to a consenting parent\u2019s request for anonymity.  (8) When no preferred placement is available, active efforts must be made and documented to place the child with a family committed to enabling the child to have visitation with \u201cextended family members,\u201d as defined in rule 5.481(a)(4)(A), and participation in the cultural and ceremonial events of the child\u2019s tribe.  (Subd (b) amended  effective January 1, 2020; previously amended effective January 1, 2013.)   233 (c) Active efforts  In addition to any other required findings to place an Indian child with someone other than a parent or Indian custodian, or to terminate parental rights, the court must find that active efforts have been made, in any proceeding listed in rule 5.480, to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family, and must find that these efforts were unsuccessful. These active efforts must include affirmative, active, thorough, and timely efforts intended primarily to maintain or reunite the child with his or her family, must be tailored to the facts and circumstances of the case, and must be consistent with the requirements of Welfare and Institutions Code section 224.1(f).   (1) The active efforts must be documented in detail in the record.  (2) The court must consider whether active efforts were made in a manner consistent with the prevailing social and cultural conditions and way of life of the Indian child\u2019s tribe.  (3) Active efforts to provide services must include pursuit of any steps necessary to secure tribal membership for a child if the child is eligible for membership in a given tribe, as well as attempts to use the available resources of extended family members, the tribe, tribal and other Indian social service agencies, and individual Indian caregivers.

Termination of parental rights  (a) Evidentiary burdens  The court may only terminate parental rights to an Indian child or declare an Indian child free of the custody and control of one or both parents if at the hearing terminating parental rights or declaring the child free of the custody and control of one or both parents, the court:   234 (1) Finds by clear and convincing evidence that active efforts to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family were made; and  (2) Makes a determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of one or more \u201cqualified expert witnesses\u201d as defined in Welfare and Institutions Code section 224.6 and Family Code section 177(a), that the continued custody of the child by the parent is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.  (b) When parental rights may not be terminated  The court may not terminate parental rights to an Indian child or declare a child free from the custody and control of one or both parents if the court finds a compelling reason for determining that termination of parental rights would not be in the child\u2019s best interest. Such a reason may include:  (1) The child is living with a relative who is unable or unwilling to adopt the child because of circumstances that do not include an unwillingness to accept legal or financial responsibility for the child, but who is willing and capable of providing the child with a stable and permanent environment through legal guardianship, and the removal of the child from the custody of his or her relative would be detrimental to the emotional well-being of the child. For purposes of an Indian child, \u201crelative\u201d must include an \u201cextended family member,\u201d as defined in the Indian Child Welfare Act (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(2));  (2) Termination of parental rights would substantially interfere with the child\u2019s connection to his or her tribal community or the child\u2019s tribal membership rights; or  (3) The child\u2019s tribe has identified tribal customary adoption, guardianship, long-term foster care with a fit and willing relative, or another planned permanent living arrangement for the child.

Petition to invalidate orders  (a) Who may petition  Any Indian child who is the subject of any action for foster-care placement, guardianship or conservatorship placement, custody placement under Family Code section 3041, declaration freeing a child from the custody and control of one or both parents, preadoptive placement, adoptive placement, or termination of parental rights; any parent or Indian custodian from whose custody such child was removed; and the Indian child\u2019s tribe may petition the court to invalidate the action on a showing that the action violated the Indian Child Welfare Act.  (Subd (a) was amended effective January 1, 2020.)  (b) Court of competent jurisdiction  If the Indian child is a dependent child or ward of the juvenile court or the subject of a pending petition, the juvenile court is a court of competent jurisdiction with the authority to hear the request to invalidate the foster placement or termination of parental rights.  (c) Request to return custody of the Indian child  If a final decree of adoption is vacated or set aside, or if the adoptive parents voluntarily consent to the termination of their parental rights, a biological parent or prior Indian custodian may request a return of custody of the Indian child.  (1) The court must reinstate jurisdiction.  (2) In a juvenile case, the juvenile court must hold a new disposition hearing in accordance with 25 United States Code section 1901 et seq. where the court may consider all placement options as stated in Welfare and Institutions Code sections 361.31(b), (c), (d), and (h).  (3) The court may consider placement with a biological parent or prior Indian custodian if the biological parent or prior Indian custodian can show that placement with him or her is not detrimental to the child and that the placement is in the best interests of the child.  (4) The hearing on the request to return custody of an Indian child must be conducted in accordance with statutory requirements and the relevant sections of this rule.   236 Rule 5.487 renumbered and amended effective January 1, 2020; adopted as rule 5.486 effective January 1, 2008; previously amended effective January 1, 2013  Rule 5.488.  Adoption record keeping  (a) Copies of adoption decree and other information to the Secretary of the Interior  After granting a decree of adoption of an Indian child, the court must provide the Secretary of the Interior with a copy of the decree and the following information:  (1) The name and tribal affiliation of the Indian child;  (2) The names and addresses of the biological parents;  (3) The names and addresses of the adoptive parents; and  (4) The agency maintaining files and records regarding the adoptive placement.  (b) Affidavit of confidentiality to the Bureau of Indian Affairs  If a biological parent has executed an affidavit requesting that his or her identity remain confidential, the court must provide the affidavit to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which must ensure the confidentiality of the information.
