Court-connected child protection/dependency mediation  (a) Purpose (\u00a7 350)  This rule establishes mandatory standards of practice and administration for court-connected dependency mediation services in accordance with section 350. This rule is intended to ensure fairness, accountability, and a high quality of service to children and families and to improve the safety, confidentiality, and consistency of dependency mediation programs statewide.  272  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Definitions  (1) \u201cDependency mediation\u201d is a confidential process conducted by specially trained, neutral third-party mediators who have no decision-making power. Dependency mediation provides a nonadversarial setting in which a mediator assists the parties in reaching a fully informed and mutually acceptable resolution that focuses on the child\u2019s safety and best interest and the safety of all family members. Dependency mediation is concerned with any and all issues related to child protection.  (2) \u201cSafety and best interest of the child\u201d refers to the child\u2019s physical, psychological, and emotional well-being. Determining the safety and best interest of the child includes consideration of all of the following:  (A) The preservation and strengthening of the family and family relationships whenever appropriate and possible;  (B) The manner in which the child may be protected from the risk of future abuse or neglect;  (C) The child\u2019s need for safety, stability, and permanency;  (D) The ongoing need of the child to cope with the issues that caused his or her involvement in the juvenile dependency system;  (E) The child\u2019s need for continuity of care and the effect that removal and subsequent placements have had, or may have, on the child; and  (F) The child\u2019s education, which includes the child\u2019s participation, progress, need for assistance, cognitive development and, if applicable, early childhood education and care, the need for special education and related services, and the extent to which the child has or has had limited English proficiency (LEP).  (3) \u201cSafety of family members\u201d refers to the physical, psychological, and emotional well-being of all family members, with consideration of the following:  (A) The role of domestic violence in creating a perceived or actual threat for the victim; and  273  (B) The ongoing need of family members to feel safe from physical, emotional, and psychological abuse.  (4) \u201cDifferential domestic violence assessment\u201d is a process used to assess the nature of any domestic violence issues in the family so that the mediator may conduct the mediation in such a way as to protect any victim of domestic violence from intimidation and to correct for power imbalances created by past violence and the fear of prospective violence.  (5) \u201cProtocols\u201d refer to any local set of rules, policies, and procedures developed and implemented by juvenile dependency mediation programs. All protocols must be developed in accordance with pertinent state laws, California Rules of Court, and local court rules.

When the participants speak different languages, interpreters, court-certified when possible, should be assigned to translate at the mediation session; and  (H) Dependency mediation services preserve, in accordance with pertinent law, party confidentiality, whether written or oral, by the:  (i) Storage and disposal of records and any personal information accumulated by the mediation program; and  (ii) Management of any new child abuse reports and related documents.
