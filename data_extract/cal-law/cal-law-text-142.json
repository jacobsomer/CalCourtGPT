{"prompt": " If a person is called as a witness and it appears to the court that the testimony or other evidence being sought may tend to incriminate the witness, the court must advise the witness of the privilege against self-incrimination and of the possible consequences of testifying. The court must also inform the witness of the right to representation by counsel and, if indigent, of the right to have counsel appointed.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Authority of judge to grant immunity  If a witness refuses to answer a question or to produce evidence based on a claim of the privilege against self-incrimination, a judge may grant immunity to the witness under (c) or (d) and order the question answered or the evidence produced.  315  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (c) Request for immunity\u2014section 602 proceedings  In proceedings under section 602, the prosecuting attorney may make a written or oral request on the record that the court order a witness to answer a question or produce evidence. The court must then proceed under Penal Code section 1324.  (1) After complying with an order to answer a question or produce evidence and if, but for those Penal Code sections or this rule, the witness would have been privileged to withhold the answer given or the evidence produced, no testimony or other information compelled under the order or information directly or indirectly derived from the testimony or other information may be used against the witness in any criminal case, including any juvenile court proceeding under section 602.  (2) The prosecuting attorney may request an order granting the witness use or transactional immunity.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 1998.)  (d) Request for immunity\u2014section 300 or 601 proceedings  In proceedings under section 300 or 601, the prosecuting attorney or petitioner may make a written or oral request on the record that the judge order a witness to answer a question or produce evidence. They may also make the request jointly.  (1) If the request is not made jointly, the other party must be given the opportunity to show why immunity is not to be granted and the judge may grant or deny the request as deemed appropriate.  (2) If jointly made, the judge must grant the request unless the judge finds that to do so would be clearly contrary to the public interest. The terms of a grant of immunity must be stated in the record.  (3) After complying with the order and if, but for this rule, the witness would have been privileged to withhold the answer given or the evidence produced, any answer given, evidence produced, or information derived there from must not be used against the witness in a juvenile court or criminal proceeding.   316 (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (e) No immunity from perjury or contempt  Notwithstanding (c) or (d), a witness may be subject to proceedings under the juvenile court law or to criminal prosecution for perjury, false swearing, or contempt committed in answering or failing to answer or in producing or failing to produce evidence in accordance with the order.  (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  Rule 5.548 amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007; adopted as rule 1421 effective January 1, 1990; previously amended effective January 1, 1998.  Rule 5.550.  Continuances  (a) Cases petitioned under section 300 (\u00a7\u00a7 316.2, 352, 354)  (1) The court must not continue a hearing beyond the time set by statute unless the court determines the continuance is not contrary to the interest of the child. In considering the child\u2019s interest, the court must give substantial weight to a child\u2019s needs for stability and prompt resolution of custody status, and the damage of prolonged temporary placements.  (2) Continuances may be granted only on a showing of good cause, and only for the time shown to be necessary. Stipulation between counsel of parties, convenience of parties, and pending criminal or family law matters are not in and of themselves good cause.  (3) If a child has been removed from the custody of a parent or guardian, the court must not grant a continuance that would cause the disposition hearing under section 361 to be completed more than 60 days after the detention hearing unless the court finds exceptional circumstances. In no event may the disposition hearing be continued more than six months after the detention hearing.  (4) In order to obtain a continuance, written notice with supporting documents must be filed and served on all parties at least two court days before the date set for hearing, unless the court finds good cause for hearing an oral motion.  (5) The court must state in its order the facts requiring any continuance that is granted.   317 (Subd (a) amended effective July 1, 2016; previously amended effective January 1, 1999, July 1, 2002, and January 1, 2007.)  (b) Cases petitioned under section 601 or 602 (\u00a7 682)  (1) A continuance may be granted only on a showing of good cause and only for the time shown to be necessary. Stipulation between counsel or parties and convenience of parties are not in and of themselves good cause.  (2) In order to obtain a continuance, written notice with supporting documents must be filed and served on all parties at least two court days before the date set for the hearing, unless the court finds good cause for failure to comply with these requirements.  (3) The court must state in its order the facts requiring any continuance that is granted.  (4) If the child is represented by counsel, failure of counsel or the child to object to an order continuing a hearing beyond the time limit is deemed a consent to the continuance.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective July 1, 2002.)  (c) Continuances of detention hearings (\u00a7\u00a7 319, 322, 635, 636, 638)  (1) On the motion of the child, parent, or guardian, the court must continue the detention hearing for one court day or for a reasonable period to permit the moving party to prepare any relevant evidence on the issue of detention. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the child must remain in custody pending the continued hearing.  (2) At the initial detention hearing, if the court continues the hearing under (c)(1) or for any other reason, or sets the matter for rehearing, the court must either find that the continuance of the child in the parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s home is contrary to the child\u2019s welfare or order the child released to the custody of the parent or guardian. The court may enter this finding on a temporary basis, without prejudice to any party, and reevaluate the finding at the time of the continued detention hearing.  (3) When the court knows or has reason to know the child is an Indian child, the detention hearing may not be continued beyond 30 days unless the court makes the findings required by section 319(e)(2).   318 (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2020; adopted effective January 1, 1998; previously amended effective July 1, 2002, and January 1, 2007.)  (d) Continuances of a dispositional hearing when the court knows or has reason to know the child is an Indian child (\u00a7 352(b))  (1) When the court knows or has reason to know that the case involves an Indian child, no continuance of a dispositional may be granted that would result in the hearing being held longer than 30 days after the hearing at which the minor was ordered removed or detained unless the court finds that there are exceptional circumstances requiring a continuance.  (2) The absence of an opinion from a qualified expert witness must not, in and of itself, support a finding that exceptional circumstances exist.  (Subd (d) adopted effective January 1, 2020.)  Rule 5.550 amended effective January 1, 2020; adopted effective January 1, 1991; previously amended effective January 1, 1998, January 1, 1999,  July 1, 2002, and July 1, 2016; previously amended and renumbered as rule 5.550 effective January 1, 2007.

(b) Petition  Juvenile case files may be obtained or inspected only in accordance with sections 827, 827.12, and 828. They may not be obtained or inspected by civil or criminal subpoena.
