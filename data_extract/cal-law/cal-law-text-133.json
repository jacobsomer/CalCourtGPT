(Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2016.)  Rule 5.505 amended effective January 1, 2016; adopted effective January 1, 2009.  Advisory Committee Comment  The juvenile dependency court performance measures and related procedures set forth in this rule fulfill the requirements of the Child Welfare Leadership and Accountability Act of 2006 (Welf. & Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16540\u201316545).  Consistent with section 16545, the Child Welfare Council and the secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency were consulted in adopting these performance measures. The appropriate court technology groups have also been consulted.  The Implementation Guide to Juvenile Dependency Court Performance Measures  is a companion publication to this rule, approved by the Judicial Council.   261 It is anticipated that the Judicial Council will update the  Implementation Guide  to Juvenile Dependency Court Performance Measures , as appropriate, to stay current with Court Case Management System (CCMS) requirements, local court needs, and the most recent versions of the relevant state and federal child welfare measures. Proposed updates other than those that are purely technical will be circulated for public comment prior to publication.   Chapter 2.  Commencement of Juvenile Court Proceedings  Rule 5.510.
