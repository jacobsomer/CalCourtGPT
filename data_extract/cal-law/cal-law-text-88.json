Advisory Committee Comment   The court must appoint counsel on the issuance of an order to show cause. ( In re Clark  (1993) 5 Cal.4th 750, 780 and People v. Shipman (1965) 62 Cal.2d 226, 231\u2013232.) The Court of Appeal has held that under Penal Code section 987.2, counties bear the expense of appointed counsel in a habeas corpus proceeding challenging the underlying conviction. ( Charlton v. Superior Court (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 858, 862.) Penal Code section 987.2 authorizes appointment of the public defender, or private counsel if there is no public defender available, for indigents in criminal proceedings.   Rule 4.552.  Habeas corpus jurisdiction  (a) Proper court to hear petition   Except as stated in (b), the petition should be heard and resolved in the court in which it is filed.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2012; previously amended effective January 1, 2006, and January 1, 2007.)  (b) Transfer of petition  (1) The superior court in which the petition is filed must determine, based on the allegations of the petition, whether the matter should be heard by it or in the superior court of another county.  (2) If the superior court in which the petition is filed determines that the matter may be more properly heard by the superior court of another county, it may nonetheless retain jurisdiction in the matter or, without first determining  114 whether a prima facie case for relief exists, order the matter transferred to the other county. Transfer may be ordered in the following circumstances:  (A) If the petition challenges the terms of a judgment, the matter may be transferred to the county in which judgment was rendered.  (B) If the petition challenges the conditions of an inmate\u2019s confinement, it may be transferred to the county in which the petitioner is confined. A change in the institution of confinement that effects a change in the conditions of confinement may constitute good cause to deny the petition.  (C) If the petition challenges the denial of parole or the petitioner\u2019s suitability for parole and is filed in a superior court other than the court that rendered the underlying judgment, the court in which the petition is filed should transfer the petition to the superior court in which the underlying judgment was rendered.  (3) The transferring court must specify in the order of transfer the reason for the transfer.  (4) If the receiving court determines that the reason for transfer is inapplicable, the receiving court must, within 30 days of receipt of the case, order the case returned to the transferring court. The transferring court must retain and resolve the matter as provided by these rules.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2012; previously amended effective January 1, 2006.)

Advisory Committee Comment   Subdivision (b)(2)(C). This subdivision is based on the California Supreme Court decision in In re Roberts  (2005) 36 Cal.4th 575, which provides that petitions for writ of habeas corpus challenging denial or suitability for parole should first be adjudicated in the trial court that rendered the underlying judgment.   115 Article 3.

Superior court appointment of counsel in death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus proceedings  (a) Purpose  This rule, in conjunction with rule 4.562, establishes a mechanism for superior courts to appoint qualified counsel to represent indigent persons in death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus proceedings. This rule governs the appointment of counsel by superior courts only, including when the Supreme Court or a Court of Appeal has transferred a habeas corpus petition without having appointed counsel for the petitioner. It does not govern the appointment of counsel by the Supreme Court or a Court of Appeal.  (b) Prioritization of oldest judgments  In the interest of equity, both to the families of victims and to persons sentenced to death, California courts, whenever possible, should appoint death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus counsel first for those persons subject to the oldest judgments of death.  (c) List of persons subject to a judgment of death  The Habeas Corpus Resource Center must maintain a list of persons subject to a judgment of death, organized by the date the judgment was entered by the sentencing court. The list must indicate whether death penalty\u2013related habeas  116 corpus counsel has been appointed for each person and, if so, the date of the appointment. The list must also indicate for each person whether a petition is pending in the Supreme Court.  (d) Notice of oldest judgments without counsel  (1) Within 30 days of the effective date of this rule, the Habeas Corpus Resource Center must identify the persons on the list required by (c) with the 25 oldest judgments of death for whom death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus counsel have not been appointed.  (2) The Habeas Corpus Resource Center must notify the presiding judges of the superior courts in which these 25 judgments of death were entered that these are the oldest cases in which habeas corpus counsel have not been appointed. The Habeas Corpus Resource Center will send a copy of the notice to the administrative presiding justice of the appellate district in which the superior court is located.  (3) The presiding judge must identify the appropriate judge within the court to make an appointment and notify the judge that the case is among the oldest cases in which habeas corpus appointments are to be made.  (4) If qualified counsel is available for appointment to a case for which a petition is pending in the Supreme Court, the judge must provide written notice to the Supreme Court that counsel is available for appointment.  (5) On entry of an order appointing death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus counsel, the appointing court must promptly send a copy of the appointment order to the Habeas Corpus Resource Center, which must update the list to reflect that counsel was appointed, and to the clerk/executive officer of the Supreme Court, the Attorney General, and the district attorney. The court must also send notice to the Habeas Corpus Resource Center, clerk/executive officer of the Supreme Court, Attorney General, and district attorney if, for any reason, the court determines that it does not need to make an appointment.  (6) When a copy of an appointment order, or information indicating that an appointment is for any reason not required, has been received by the Habeas Corpus Resource Center for 20 judgments, the center will identify the next 20 oldest judgments of death in cases in which death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus counsel have not been appointed and send out a notice identifying these 20 judgments, and the procedures required by paragraphs (3) through (6) of this subdivision must be repeated.  (7) The presiding judge of a superior court may designate another judge within the court to carry out his or her duties in this subdivision.   117 (e) Appointment of counsel  (1) After the court receives a notice under (d)(2) and has made the findings required by Government Code section 68662, the appropriate judge must appoint a qualified attorney or attorneys to represent the person in death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus proceedings.  (2) The superior court must appoint an attorney or attorneys from the statewide panel of counsel compiled under rule 4.562(d)(4); an entity that employs qualified attorneys, including the Habeas Corpus Resource Center, the local public defender\u2019s office, or alternate public defender\u2019s office; or if the court has adopted a local rule under 4.562(g), an attorney determined to be qualified under that court\u2019s local rules. The court must at this time also designate an assisting entity or counsel, unless the appointed counsel is employed by the Habeas Corpus Resource Center.  (3) When the court appoints counsel to represent a person in a death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus proceeding under this subdivision, the court must complete and enter an Order Appointing Counsel in Death Penalty\u2013Related Habeas Corpus Proceeding  (form HC-101).  Rule 4.561 adopted effective April 25, 2019.  Rule 4.562.  Recruitment and determination of qualifications of attorneys for appointment in death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus proceedings   (a) Purpose  This rule provides for a panel of attorneys from which superior courts may appoint counsel in death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus proceedings.  (b) Regional habeas corpus panel committees  Each Court of Appeal must establish a death penalty\u2013related habeas corpus panel committee as provided in this rule.  (c) Composition of regional habeas corpus panel committees  (1) The administrative presiding justice of the Court of Appeal appoints the \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
