Code, \u00a7 7900 et seq.)  This rule implements the purposes and provisions of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC, or the compact). California juvenile courts must apply this rule when placing children who are dependents or wards of the juvenile court and for whom placement is indicated in any other state, the District of Columbia, or the U.S. Virgin Islands.  (1) This rule applies to expedited placements as described in (h).  (2) This rule does not apply to placements made under the Interstate Compact for Juveniles (Welf. & Inst. Code, \u00a7 1400 et seq.).  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2013; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Definitions (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7900 et seq.; ICPC Regulations)  (1) \u201cPlacement\u201d is defined in article 2(d) of the compact. It includes placements with a relative, as defined in Regulation No. 3, paragraph 4, item 56; a legal  364 guardian of the child; a placement recipient who is not related to the child; or a residential facility or group home as defined in Regulation No. 4.  (A) A court\u2019s directing or making an award of custody to a parent of the child or placing a child with his or her parent is not a placement requiring compliance with this rule.  (B) The following situations each constitute a placement, and the compact must be applied:  (i) An order causing a child to be sent or brought to a person, other than a parent, in a compact jurisdiction without a specific date of return to the sending jurisdiction;  (ii) An order causing a child to be sent or brought to a person, other than a parent, in a compact jurisdiction with a return date more than 30 days from the start of the visit or beyond the ending date of a school vacation period, under Regulation No. 9;  (iii) An out-of-state placement for the purpose of an anticipated adoption, whether independent, private, or public;  (iv) An out-of-state placement with a related or unrelated caregiver in a licensed or approved foster home;  (v) An out-of-state placement with relatives, except when a parent or relative sends or brings the child to the relative's home in the receiving state, as defined in article 8(a) of the ICPC; or  (vi) An out-of-state group home or residential placement of any child, including a child adjudicated delinquent.  (2) \u201cChild,\u201d for the purposes of ICPC placement, includes nonminor dependents up to age 21. If a California nonminor dependent is to be placed out of state, the placing county may request supervision from the receiving state, but such services are discretionary. If the receiving state will not supervise the nonminor dependent, the sending county must make other supervision arrangements, which may include contracting with a private agency to provide the supervision.  (3) \u201cParent,\u201d as used in this rule, does not include de facto parents or legal guardians.   365 (4) ICPC Regulations Nos. 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, and 12 contain additional definitions that apply to California ICPC cases, except where inconsistent with this rule or with California law.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2014; previously amended effective January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2013.)  (c) Compact requirements (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7901; ICPC Regulations)  Whenever the juvenile court makes a placement in another jurisdiction included in the compact or reviews a placement plan, the court must adhere to the provisions and regulations of the compact.  (1) Cases in which out-of-state placement is proposed in order to place a child for public adoption, in foster care, or with relatives, and where the criteria for expedited placement are not met, must meet all requirements of Regulation No. 2, except where inconsistent with California law.  (2) Expedited placement cases must meet the requirements in (h) and of Regulation No. 7, except where the requirements of Regulation No. 7 are inconsistent with California law.
