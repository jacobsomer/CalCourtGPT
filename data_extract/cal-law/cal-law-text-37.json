{"prompt": "amended effective January 1, 2016.  Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivisions (a)\u2013(b).  These subdivisions provide that the presiding judge in each court is responsible for determining whether court-appointed temporary judges need to be used in that court, and these subdivisions furnish the criteria for determining when their use is proper.  Under (b)(1), the use and appointment of court-appointed temporary judges must be based on judicial needs.  Under (b)(3), an attorney serving as a temporary judge would have a conflict of interest if the disqualifying factors in the Code of Judicial Ethics exist. Under (b)(4), the test for the appearance of impropriety is whether a person aware of the facts might entertain a doubt that the judge would be able to act with integrity, impartiality, and competence.  In addition to the disqualifying factors listed in the Code of Judicial Ethics, an appearance of impropriety would be generated if any of the limitations in family law, unlawful detainer, and other cases identified in the Code of Judicial Ethics are present.   Rule 10.743.  Administrator of temporary judges program  (a) Administrator  The presiding judge who appoints attorneys as temporary judges must designate a clerk, executive officer, or other court employee knowledgeable about temporary judges to serve as the Temporary Judge Administrator in that court.  (b) Duties of administrator  Under the supervision of the presiding judge, the Temporary Judge Administrator is responsible for the management of the temporary judges program in the court. The administrator\u2019s duties include:  (1) Receiving and processing applications from attorneys to serve as temporary judges with the court;  (2) Verifying the information on the applications;  (3) Assisting the presiding judge in the recruitment and selection of attorneys to serve as temporary judges, as provided in rule 10.741;  (4) Administering the court\u2019s program for the education and training of temporary judges;  (5) Maintaining records of attendance and completion of required courses by all attorneys serving as temporary judges in the court;   220 (6) Determining that attorneys have satisfied all the conditions required to be appointed as a temporary judge in that court, including continuing education requirements;  (7) Maintaining a list of attorneys currently appointed and qualified to serve as temporary judges in the court;  (8) Managing support services for temporary judges, such as providing mentoring programs and reference materials;  (9) Receiving and processing complaints and other information concerning the performance of attorneys serving as temporary judges;  (10) Assisting the presiding judge in identifying judicial needs that require the use of temporary judges and in addressing these needs; and  (11) Maintaining records, gathering statistics, and preparing and transmitting quarterly reports on the court\u2019s use of temporary judges as required under rule 10.742(c).  (Subd (b) amended effective July 1, 2012; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  Rule 10.743 amended effective July 1, 2012; adopted as rule 6.743 effective July 1, 2006; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007.  Advisory Committee Comment  The goal of this rule is to ensure the effective and efficient administration of the courts\u2019 use of temporary judges. The rule should be applied flexibly. In courts with large temporary judge programs, the court may want to designate a full-time administrator, and some of the administrator\u2019s duties may be delegated to other individuals. On the other hand, in courts that use only a few temporary judges, the Temporary Judge Administrator position may consume only part of the administrator\u2019s time and be combined with other duties. Also, courts that use only a small number of temporary judges may work with other courts, or may cooperate on a regional basis, to perform the functions and duties prescribed under this rule.  Rule 10.744.

The attorney must disclose the changes to the court before the next time the attorney is assigned to serve as a temporary judge.  (d) Review of application  The presiding judge, assisted by the Temporary Judge Administrator, must review all applications and determine whether each applicant is qualified, has satisfied the requirements of rule 2.812, and should be appointed as a temporary judge. The presiding judge may delegate this task to another judge or a committee of judges, assisted by the Temporary Judge Administrator. In appointing attorneys as temporary judges, the presiding judge may go beyond the minimum qualifications and standards required under the California Rules of Court. The decision whether to appoint, use, retrain, remove, or discontinue using any particular attorney as a temporary judge is at the sole discretion of the presiding judge.
