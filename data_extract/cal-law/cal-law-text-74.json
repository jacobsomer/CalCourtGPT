{"prompt": "Questionnaire for Criminal Cases (form MC-002) may be used. After completion of the initial examination, the court must permit counsel to conduct supplemental questioning as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 223.  Rule 4.201 amended effective January 1, 2006; adopted as rule 228.2 effective June 6, 1990; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2001.  Advisory Committee Comment  Although Code of Civil Procedure section 223 creates a preference for nonsequestered voir dire (People v. Roldan  (2005) 35 Cal.4th 646, 691), a judge may conduct sequestered voir dire on questions concerning media reports of the case and on any other issue deemed advisable. (See, e.g., Cal. Stds. Jud. Admin., std. 4.30(a)(3).) To determine whether such issues are present, a judge may consider factors including the charges, the nature of the evidence that is anticipated to be presented, and any other relevant factors. To that end, a judge should always inform jurors of the possibility of sequestered voir dire if the voir dire is likely to elicit answers that the juror may believe are sensitive in nature. It should also be noted that when written questionnaires are used, jurors must be advised of the right to request a hearing in chambers on sensitive questions rather than answering them on the questionnaire. ( Copley Press Inc. v. Superior Court (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 77, 87.)   Rule 4.202.  Statements to the jury panel  Prior to the examination of prospective jurors, the trial judge may, in his or her discretion, permit brief opening statements by counsel to the panel.  Rule 4.202 adopted effective January 1, 2013.  Comment  This statement is not a substitute for opening statements. Its purpose is to place voir dire questions in context and to generate interest in the case so that prospective jurors will be less inclined to claim marginal hardships.   42 Rule 4.210.  Traffic court\u2014trial by written declaration  (a) Applicability   This rule establishes the minimum procedural requirements for trials by written declaration under Vehicle Code section 40902. The procedures established by this rule must be followed in all trials by written declaration under that section.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Procedure  (1) Definition of due date   As used in this subdivision, \u201cdue date\u201d means the last date on which the defendant\u2019s appearance is timely.  (2) Extending due date   If the clerk receives the defendant\u2019s written request for a trial by written declaration by the appearance date indicated on the Notice to Appear, the clerk must, within 15 calendar days after receiving the defendant\u2019s written request, extend the appearance date 25 calendar days and must give or mail notice to the defendant of the extended due date on the Request for Trial by Written Declaration (form TR-205) with a copy of the Instructions to Defendant (form TR-200) and any other required forms.  (3) Election  The defendant must file a Request for Trial by Written Declaration (form TR-205) with the clerk by the appearance date indicated on the Notice to Appear or the extended due date as provided in (2). The Request for Trial by Written Declaration (form TR-205) must be filed in addition to the defendant\u2019s written request for a trial by written declaration, unless the defendant\u2019s request was made on the election form.  (4) Bail  The defendant must deposit bail with the clerk by the appearance date indicated on the Notice to Appear  or the extended due date as provided in (2).  (5) Instructions to arresting officer   If the clerk receives the defendant\u2019s Request for Trial by Written Declaration  (form TR-205) and bail by the due date, the clerk must deliver or mail to the arresting officer\u2019s agency Notice and Instructions to Arresting Officer (form TR-210) and  Officer\u2019s Declaration  (form TR-235) with a copy of the Notice  43 to Appear and a specified return date for receiving the officer\u2019s declaration. After receipt of the officer\u2019s declaration, or at the close of the officer\u2019s return date if no officer\u2019s declaration is filed, the clerk must submit the case file with all declarations and other evidence received to the court for decision.  (6) Court decision   After the court decides the case and returns the file and decision, the clerk must immediately deliver or mail the Decision and Notice of Decision (form TR-215) to the defendant and the arresting agency.  (7) Trial de novo   If the defendant files a Request for New Trial (Trial de Novo) (form TR-220) within 20 calendar days after the date of delivery or mailing of the Decision and Notice of Decision (form TR-215), the clerk must set a trial date within 45 calendar days of receipt of the defendant\u2019s written request for a new trial. The clerk must deliver or mail to the defendant and to the arresting officer\u2019s agency the Order and Notice to Defendant of New Trial (Trial de Novo)  (form TR-225). If the defendant\u2019s request is not timely received, no new trial may be held and the case must be closed.  (8) Case and time standard   The clerk must deliver or mail the Decision and Notice of Decision (form TR-215) within 90 calendar days after the due date. Acts for which no specific time is stated in this rule must be performed promptly so that the Decision and Notice of Decision can be timely delivered or mailed by the clerk. Failure of the clerk or the court to comply with any time limit does not void or invalidate the decision of the court, unless prejudice to the defendant is shown.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2000, and July 1, 2000.)  (c) Due dates and time limits  Due dates and time limits must be as stated in this rule, unless changed or extended by the court. The court may extend any date, but the court need not state the reasons for granting or denying an extension on the record or in the minutes.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (d) Ineligible defendants  If the defendant requests a trial by written declaration and the clerk or the court determines that the defendant is not eligible for a trial by written declaration, the  44 clerk must extend the due date 25 calendar days and notify the defendant by mail of the determination and due date. (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (e) Noncompliance  If the defendant does not comply with this rule (including submitting the required bail amount, signing and filing all required forms, and complying with all time limits and due dates), the court may deny a trial by written declaration and may proceed as otherwise provided by statute and court rules.  (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (f) Evidence  Testimony and other relevant evidence may be introduced in the form of a Notice to Appear issued under Vehicle Code section 40500; a business record or receipt; a sworn declaration of the arresting officer; and, on behalf of the defendant, a sworn declaration of the defendant.  (Subd (f) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (g) Fines, assessments, or penalties  The statute and the rules do not prevent or preclude the court from imposing on a defendant who is found guilty any lawful fine, assessment, or other penalty, and the court is not limited to imposing money penalties in the bail amount, unless the bail amount is the maximum and the only lawful penalty.  (Subd (g) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (h) Additional forms and procedures  The clerk may approve and prescribe forms, time limits, and procedures that are not in conflict with or not inconsistent with the statute or this rule.
