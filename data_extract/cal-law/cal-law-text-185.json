(Subd (h) adopted effective May 22, 2017.)  Rule 5.770 amended effective January 1, 2023; adopted as rule 1482 effective January 1, 1991; previously amended effective January 1, 1996, January 1, 2001, July 1, 2002, May 22, 2017, and January 1, 2021; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2007.   560 Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivision (b).  This subdivision reflects changes to section 707 as a result of the passage of Senate Bill 382 (Lara; Stats. 2015, ch. 234) and Proposition 57, the Public Safety and Rehabilitation Act of 2016. SB 382 was intended to clarify the factors for the juvenile court to consider when determining whether a case should be transferred to criminal court by emphasizing the unique developmental characteristics of children and their prior interactions with the juvenile justice system. Proposition 57 provided that its intent was to promote rehabilitation for juveniles and prevent them from reoffending, and to ensure that a judge makes the determination that a youth should be tried in a criminal court. Consistent with this intent, the committee urges juvenile courts\u2014when evaluating the statutory criteria to determine if transfer is appropriate\u2014to look at the totality of the circumstances, taking into account the specific statutory language guiding the court in its consideration of the criteria.  Under subdivision (b)(2), the court must state on the record the basis for its decision. The statement of decision must fully explain the court\u2019s reasoning to allow for meaningful appellate review. See, e.g., C.S. v. Superior Court  (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 1009.  Subdivision (c).  While this rule and section 707 only require the juvenile court to recite the basis for its decision when the transfer motion is granted, the advisory committee believes that juvenile courts should, as a best practice, state the basis for their decisions on these motions in all cases so that the parties have an adequate record from which to seek subsequent review.

(d) Dismissal  Absent a continuance under rule 5.776, when a jurisdiction hearing is not begun within the time limits of (a) and (b), the court must order the petition dismissed.

Absent a waiver of time, a child may not be detained beyond the statutory time limits.  (2) The court must state in its order the facts requiring any continuance that is granted.  (3) If the child is represented by counsel and no objection is made to an order setting or continuing the jurisdiction hearing beyond the time limits of rule 5.774, consent must be implied.

(c) Grounds for continuance\u2014discretionary (\u00a7\u00a7 700.5, 701)  The court may continue the jurisdiction hearing for no more than seven calendar days to enable the petitioner to subpoena witnesses if the child has made an extrajudicial admission and denies it, or has previously indicated to the court or petitioner an intention to admit the allegations of the petition, and at the time set for jurisdiction hearing denies the allegations.  (d) Grounds for continuance\u2014section 654.2 (\u00a7\u00a7 654.2, 654.3, 654.4)  In a case petitioned under section 602, the court may, with the consent of the child and the parent or guardian, continue the jurisdiction hearing for six months.

(Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (c) Admission of allegations; prerequisites to acceptance  The court must then inquire whether the child intends to admit or deny the allegations of the petition. If the child neither admits nor denies the allegations, the court must state on the record that the child does not admit the allegations. If the child wishes to admit the allegations, the court must first find and state on the record that it is satisfied that the child understands the nature of the allegations and the direct consequences of the admission, and understands and waives the rights in (b).

If any offense may be found to be either a felony or misdemeanor, the court must consider which description applies and expressly declare on the record that it has made such consideration and must state its determination as to whether the offense is a misdemeanor or a felony. These determinations may be deferred until the disposition hearing. \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
