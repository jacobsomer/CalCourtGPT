Advisory Committee Comment   Subdivision (a) of this rule defines a court-funded trust as a product of three court proceedings. Two of these\u2014a petition for substituted judgment in a probate conservatorship (Prob. Code,  \u00a7 2580) and a proceeding for a particular transaction in the property of an impaired spouse or domestic partner without a conservator (Prob. Code, \u00a7 3100; Fam. Code, \u00a7 297.5)\u2014are regularly heard in the probate department of the court. The third proceeding, an application for an order approving the settlement of a minor\u2019s claim or a pending action involving a minor or person with a disability or approving the disposition of the proceeds of a judgment in favor of a minor or person with a disability (Prob. Code, \u00a7 3600), may be heard in either a probate or a civil department.  The Judicial Council has adopted standard 7.10 of the Standards of Judicial Administration to address proceedings under Probate Code section 3600 that involve court-funded trusts and are heard in civil departments. The standard makes two recommendations concerning the expertise of judicial officers who hear these proceedings on trust issues. The recommendations are to develop practices and procedures that (1) provide for determination of the trust issues in these matters by the probate department of the court or by a judicial officer who regularly hears probate proceedings or (2) ensure that judicial officers who hear these matters have experience or receive training in substantive and technical issues involving trusts, including special needs trusts.
