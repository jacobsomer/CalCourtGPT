(d) Conduct of hearing  At the hearing, the court must state on the record that the court has read and considered the report of petitioner, the report of any CASA volunteer, the case plan submitted for this hearing, any report submitted by the child\u2019s caregiver under section 366.21(d), and any other evidence, and must proceed under section 366.26 and as follows:  (1) In the case of an Indian child, after the agency has consulted with the tribe, when the court has determined with the concurrence of the tribe that tribal customary adoption is the appropriate permanent plan for the child, order a tribal customary adoption in accordance with section 366.24.  (2) The party claiming that termination of parental rights would be detrimental to the child has the burden of proving the detriment.  (3) If the court finds that section 366.26(c)(1)(A) or section 366.26(c)(2)(A) applies, the court must appoint the present custodian or other appropriate person to become the child\u2019s legal guardian or must order the child to remain in foster care.

The foster parent or relative must be willing to provide, and capable of providing, a stable and permanent home for the child and must have substantial psychological ties with the child.  (4) The court must consider the case plan submitted for this hearing and must make the required findings and determinations in rule 5.708(e).

(e) Procedures\u2014adoption  (1) The court must follow the procedures in section 366.24 or 366.26, as appropriate.  (2) An order of the court terminating parental rights, ordering adoption under section 366.26 or, in the case of an Indian child, ordering tribal customary adoption under section 366.24, is conclusive and binding on the child, the parent, and all other persons who have been served under the provisions of section 294. Once a final order of adoption has issued, the order may not be set aside or modified by the court, except as provided in section 366.26(e)(3) and (i)(3) and rules 5.538, 5.540, and 5.542 with regard to orders by a referee.

The rights of all parents\u2014whether natural, presumed, biological, alleged, or unknown\u2014must be terminated in order to free the child for adoption.

The court may make the designation on its own motion or on a request by a caregiver, the child, a social worker, the child\u2019s identified Indian tribe, or the attorney for any of these parties.  (1) A request for designation as a prospective adoptive parent may be made at a hearing where parental rights are terminated or a plan of tribal customary adoption is ordered or thereafter, whether or not the child\u2019s removal from the home of the prospective adoptive parent is at issue.  (2) A request may be made orally.  523  (3) If a request for prospective adoptive parent designation is made in writing, it must be made on Request for Prospective Adoptive Parent Designation (form JV-321).  (4) The address and telephone number of the caregiver and the child may be kept confidential by filing Confidential Information\u2014Prospective Adoptive Parent (form JV-322), with form JV-321. Form JV-322 must be kept in the court file under seal, and only the court, the child\u2019s attorney, the agency, and the child\u2019s CASA volunteer may have access to this information.  (Subd (a) amended effective July 1, 2010; previously amended effective January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2008.)  (b) Facilitation steps  Steps to facilitate the adoption process include those listed in section 366.26(n)(2) and, in the case of an Indian child when tribal customary adoption has been identified as the child\u2019s permanent plan, the child\u2019s identified Indian tribe has designated the caregiver as the prospective adoptive parent.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2017; previously amended effective January 1, 2007, and July 1, 2010.)  (c) Hearing on request for prospective adoptive parent designation  (1) The court must determine whether the caregiver meets the criteria in section 366.26(n)(1).  (2) If the court finds that the caregiver does not meet the criteria in section 366.26(n)(1), the court may deny the request without a hearing.  (3) If the court finds that the caregiver meets the criteria in section 366.26(n)(1), the court must set a hearing as set forth in (4) below.  (4) If it appears to the court that the request for designation as a prospective adoptive parent will be contested, or if the court wants to receive further evidence on the request, the court must set a hearing.  (A) If the request for designation is made at the same time a petition is filed to object to removal of the child from the caregiver\u2019s home, the court must set a hearing as follows:   524 (i) The hearing must be set as soon as possible and not later than five court days after the petition objecting to removal is filed with the court.  (ii) If the court for good cause cannot set the matter for hearing five court days after the petition objecting to removal is filed, the court must set the matter for hearing as soon as possible.  (iii) The matter may be set for hearing more than five court days after the petition objecting to removal is filed if this delay is necessary to allow participation by the child\u2019s identified Indian tribe or the child\u2019s Indian custodian.  (B) If the request for designation is made before the agency serves notice of a proposed removal or before an emergency removal has occurred, the court must set a hearing within 30 calendar days after the request for designation is made.  (5) If all parties stipulate to the designation of the caregiver as a prospective adoptive parent, the court may order the designation without a hearing.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2017.)  (d) Notice of designation hearing  After the court has ordered a hearing on a request for prospective-adoptive-parent designation, notice of the hearing must be as described below.  (1) The following participants must be noticed:  (A) The adoption agency;  (B) The current caregiver,  (C) The child\u2019s attorney;  (D) The child, if the child is 10 years of age or older;  (E) The child\u2019s identified Indian tribe if any;  (F) The child\u2019s Indian custodian if any; and  \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
