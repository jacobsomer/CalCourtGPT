(Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2014; adopted effective January 1, 2007.)  (d) Denial of hearing  The court may deny the petition ex parte if:  (1) The petition filed under section 388(a) or section 778(a) fails to state a change of circumstance or new evidence that may require a change of order or termination of jurisdiction or fails to show that the requested modification would promote the best interest of the child, nonminor, or nonminor dependent.  (2) The petition filed under section 388(b) fails to demonstrate that the requested modification would promote the best interest of the dependent child;   339 (3) The petition filed under section 388(b) or 778(b) requests visits with a nondependent child and demonstrates that sibling visitation is contrary to the safety and well-being of any of the siblings;  (4) The petition filed under section 388(b) or 778(b) requests visits with a nondependent sibling who remains in the custody of a mutual parent who is not subject to the court\u2019s jurisdiction; or  (5) The petition filed under section 388(c) fails to state facts showing that the parent has failed to visit the child or that the parent has failed to participate regularly and make substantive progress in a court-ordered treatment plan or fails to show that the requested termination of services would promote the best interest of the child.  (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2016; adopted as subd (b); previously amended and relettered as subd (d) effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2010, and January 1, 2014.)  (e) Grounds for grant of petition (\u00a7\u00a7 388, 778)  (1) If the petition filed under section 388(a) or section 778(a) states a change of circumstance or new evidence and it appears that the best interest of the child, nonminor, or nonminor dependent may be promoted by the proposed change of order or termination of jurisdiction, the court may grant the petition after following the procedures in (f), (g), and (h), or (i).  (2) If the petition is filed under section 388(b) and it appears that the best interest of the child, nonminor, or nonminor dependent may be promoted by the proposed recognition of a sibling relationship or other requested orders, the court may grant the petition after following the procedures in (f), (g), and (h).  (3) If the petition is filed under section 388(b), the request is for visitation with a sibling who is not a dependent of the court and who is in the custody of a parent subject to the court\u2019s jurisdiction, and that sibling visitation is not contrary to the safety and well-being of any of the siblings, the court may grant the request after following the procedures in (f), (g), and (h).  (4) If the petition is filed under section 778(b), the request is for visitation with a sibling who is not a dependent of the court and who is in the custody of a parent subject to the court\u2019s jurisdiction, and that sibling visitation is not contrary to the safety and well being of the ward or any of the siblings, the court may grant the request after following the procedures in (f), (g), and (i).   340 (5) For a petition filed under section 388(c)(1)(A), the court may terminate reunification services during the time periods described in section 388(c)(1) only if the court finds by a preponderance of evidence that reasonable services have been offered or provided, and, by clear and convincing evidence, that the change of circumstance or new evidence described in the petition satisfies a condition in section 361.5(b) or (e). In the case of an Indian child, the court may terminate reunification services only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family within the meaning of sections 224.1(f) and 361.7 and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful. The court may grant the petition after following the procedures in (f), (g), and (h).  (6) For a petition filed under section 388(c)(1)(B), the court may terminate reunification services during the time periods described in section 388(c)(1) only if the court finds by a preponderance of evidence that reasonable services have been offered or provided, and, by clear and convincing evidence, that action or inaction by the parent or guardian creates a substantial likelihood that reunification will not occur. Such action or inaction includes, but is not limited to, failure to visit the child or failure to participate regularly and make substantive progress in a court-ordered treatment program. In determining whether the parent or guardian has failed to visit the child or to participate regularly or make progress in a court-ordered treatment plan, the court must consider factors including, but not limited to, the parent or guardian\u2019s incarceration, institutionalization, or participation in a residential substance abuse treatment program. In the case of an Indian child, the court may terminate reunification services only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family within the meaning of sections 224.1(f) and 361.7 and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful. The court may grant the petition after following the procedures in (f), (g), and (h).  (7) If the petition filed under section 388(a) is filed before an order terminating parental rights and is seeking to modify an order that reunification services need not be provided under section 361.5(b)(4), (5), or (6) or to modify any orders related to custody or visitation of the child for whom reunification services were not ordered under section 361.5(b)(4), (5), or (6), the court may modify the orders only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed change is in the best interests of the child. The court may grant the petition after following the procedures in (f), (g), and (h).   341 (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2020; adopted as subd (c); previously amended and relettered as subd (e) effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 2010, January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2016.)  (f) Hearing on petition  If all parties stipulate to the requested modification, the court may order modification without a hearing. If there is no such stipulation and the petition has not been denied ex parte under section (d), the court must either:  (1) order that a hearing on the petition be held within 30 calendar days after the petition is filed; or  (2) order a hearing for the parties to argue whether an evidentiary hearing on the petition should be granted or denied. If the court then grants an evidentiary hearing on the petition, that hearing must be held within 30 calendar days after the petition is filed.  (Subd (f) amended effective January 1, 2016; adopted as subd (d); previously relettered as subd (f) effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective July 1, 2002, and January 1, 2010.)  (g) Notice of petition and hearing (\u00a7\u00a7 388, 778)  (1) If a petition is filed under section 388 or section 778 to terminate juvenile court jurisdiction over a nonminor, notice of the hearing must be given as required by section 295.  (2) For hearings on all other petitions filed under section 388 or section 778, notice of the hearing must be provided as required under section 297, or sections 776 and 779, except that notice to parents or former guardians of a nonminor must be provided only if the nonminor requests, in writing on the face of the petition, that such notice be provided, or if the parent or legal guardian is receiving court-ordered family reunification services.  Subd (g) amended effective January 1, 2019; repealed and adopted as subd (e); previously amended effective January 1, 1992, July 1, 1995, July 1, 2000, July 1, 2002; and January 1, 2014; previously amended and relettered as subd (g) effective January 1, 2007.)  (h) Conduct of hearing (\u00a7 388)  (1) The petitioner requesting the modification under section 388 has the burden of proof.  342  (A) If the request is for the removal of the child from the child\u2019s home, the petitioner must show by clear and convincing evidence that the grounds for removal in section 361(c) exist.  (B) If the request is for termination of court-ordered reunification services, the petitioner must show by clear and convincing evidence that one of the conditions in section 388(c)(1)(A) or (B) exists and must show by a preponderance of the evidence that reasonable services have been offered or provided. In the case of an Indian child, the court may terminate reunification services only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family within the meaning of sections 224.1(f) and 361.7 and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.  (C) If the request is to modify an order that reunification services were not ordered under section 361.5(b)(4), (5), or (6) or to modify any orders related to custody or visitation of the child for whom reunification services were not ordered under section 361.5(b)(4), (5), or (6), the petitioner must show by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed change is in the best interests of the child.  (D) All other requests require a preponderance of the evidence to show that the child\u2019s welfare requires such a modification  \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
