Rule 5.642. Authorization to release psychotropic medication prescription information to Medical Board of California  (a) Providing authorization forms   Whenever there is an Application for Psychotropic Medication (form JV-220) filed with the court under rule 5.640, the applicant must review the Physician\u2019s Statement\u2014Attachment (form JV-220(A)) or Physician\u2019s Request to Continue Medication\u2014Attachment (form JV-220(B)) to determine if the request would result in the child being prescribed three or more concurrent psychotropic medications for 90 days or more, as described in section 14028. If the request would result in the child being prescribed three or more psychotropic medications for 90 days or more, the applicant must provide blank copies of Position on Release of Information to Medical Board of California (form JV-228), Background on Release of Information to Medical Board of California  (form JV-228-INFO), and Withdrawal of Release of Information to Medical Board of California  (form JV-229) to the child and the child\u2019s attorney.

Mental health or condition of child; court procedures  (a) Doubt concerning the mental health of a child (\u00a7\u00a7 357, 705, 6550, 6551)  Whenever the court believes that the child who is the subject of a petition filed under section 300, 601, or 602 is mentally disabled or may be mentally ill, the court  402 may stay the proceedings and order the child taken to a facility designated by the court and approved by the State Department of Mental Health as a facility for 72-hour treatment and evaluation. The professional in charge of the facility must submit a written evaluation of the child to the court.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Findings regarding a mental disorder (\u00a7 6551)  Article 1 of chapter 2 of part 1 of division 5 (commencing with section 5150) applies.  (1) If the professional reports that the child is not in need of intensive treatment, the child must be returned to the juvenile court on or before the expiration of the 72-hour period, and the court must proceed with the case under section 300, 601, or 602.  (2) If the professional in charge of the facility finds that the child is in need of intensive treatment for a mental disorder, the child may be certified for not more than 14 days of involuntary intensive treatment according to the conditions of sections 5250(c) and 5260(b). The stay of the juvenile court proceedings must remain in effect during this time.  (A) During or at the end of the 14 days of involuntary intensive treatment, a certification may be sought for additional treatment under sections commencing with 5270.10 or for the initiation of proceedings to have a conservator appointed for the child under sections commencing with 5350. The juvenile court may retain jurisdiction over the child during proceedings under sections 5270.10 et seq. and 5350 et seq.  (B) For a child subject to a petition under section 602, if the child is found to be gravely disabled under sections 5300 et seq., a conservator is appointed under those sections, and the professional in charge of the child\u2019s treatment or of the treatment facility determines that proceedings under section 602 would be detrimental to the child, the juvenile court must suspend jurisdiction while the conservatorship remains in effect. The suspension of jurisdiction may end when the conservatorship is terminated, and the original 602 matter may be calendared for further proceedings.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)   403 (c) Findings regarding developmental disability (\u00a7 6551)  Article 1 of chapter 2 of part 1 of division 5 (commencing with section 5150) applies.  (1) If the professional finds that the child has a developmental disability and recommends commitment to a state hospital, the court may direct the filing in the appropriate court of a petition for commitment of a child who has a developmental disability to the State Department of Developmental Services for placement in a state hospital.  (2) If the professional finds that the child does not have a developmental disability, the child must be returned to the juvenile court on or before the expiration of the 72-hour period, and the court must proceed with the case under section 300, 601, or 602.  (3) The jurisdiction of the juvenile court must be suspended while the child is subject to the jurisdiction of the appropriate court under a petition for commitment of a person who has a developmental disability, or under remand for 90 days for intensive treatment or commitment ordered by that court.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2020; previously amended effective January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2009.)  (d) Doubt as to capacity to cooperate with counsel (\u00a7\u00a7 601, 602; Pen. Code, \u00a7 1367)  (1) If the court finds that there is substantial evidence that a child who is the subject of a petition filed under section 601 or 602 lacks sufficient present ability to consult with counsel and assist in preparing his or her defense with a reasonable degree of rational understanding, or lacks a rational as well as factual understanding of the nature of the charges or proceedings against him or her, the court must suspend the proceedings and conduct a hearing regarding the child\u2019s competence. Evidence is substantial if it raises a reasonable doubt about the child\u2019s competence to stand trial.  (A) The court must appoint an expert to examine the child to evaluate whether the child suffers from a mental disorder, developmental disability, developmental immaturity, or other condition and, if so, whether the condition or conditions impair the child\u2019s competency.  (B) To be appointed as an expert, an individual must be a:   404 (i) Licensed psychiatrist who has successfully completed four years of medical school and either four years of general psychiatry residency, including one year of internship and two years of child and adolescent fellowship training, or three years of general psychiatry residency, including one year of internship and one year of residency that focus on children and adolescents and one year of child and adolescent fellowship training; or  (ii) Clinical, counseling, or school psychologist who has received a doctoral degree in psychology from an educational institution accredited by an organization recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation and who is licensed as a psychologist.  (C) The expert, whether a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist, must:  (i) Possess demonstrable professional experience addressing child and adolescent developmental issues, including the emotional, behavioral, and cognitive impairments of children and adolescents;  (ii) Have expertise in the cultural and social characteristics of children and adolescents;  (iii) Possess a curriculum vitae reflecting training and experience in the forensic evaluation of children;  (iv) Be familiar with juvenile competency standards and accepted criteria used in evaluating juvenile competence;  (v) Possess a comprehensive understanding of effective interventions as well as treatment, training, and programs for the attainment of competency available to children and adolescents; and  (vi) Be proficient in the language preferred by the child, or if that is not feasible, employ the services of a certified interpreter and use assessment tools that are linguistically and culturally appropriate for the child.  (2) Nothing in this rule precludes involvement of clinicians with other professional qualifications from participation as consultants or witnesses or in other capacities relevant to the case.   405 (3) Following the hearing on competence, the court must proceed as directed in section 709.
