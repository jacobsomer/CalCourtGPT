At the readiness conference:  (1) All trial counsel must appear and be prepared to discuss the case and determine whether the case can be disposed of without trial;  (2) The prosecuting attorney must have authority to dispose of the case; and   (3) The defendant must be present in court.

Rule 4.113.  Motions and grounds for continuance of criminal case set for trial  Motions to continue the trial of a criminal case are disfavored and will be denied unless the moving party, under Penal Code section 1050, presents affirmative proof in open court that the ends of justice require a continuance.  Rule 4.113 amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as rule 227.7 effective January 1, 1985 previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001.  Rule 4.114.  Certification under Penal Code section 859a  When a plea of guilty or no contest is entered under Penal Code section 859a, the magistrate must:   (1) Set a date for imposing sentence; and  (2) Refer the case to the probation officer for action as provided in Penal Code sections 1191 and 1203.  Rule 4.114 amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as rule 227.9 effective January 1, 1985; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2001.  Rule 4.115.  Criminal case assignment  (a) Master calendar departments  To ensure that the court\u2019s policy on continuances is firm and uniformly applied, that pretrial proceedings and trial assignments are handled consistently, and that cases are tried on a date certain, each court not operating on a direct calendaring system must assign all criminal matters to one or more master calendar departments. The presiding judge of a master calendar department must conduct or supervise the conduct of all arraignments and pretrial hearings and conferences and assign to a trial department any case requiring a trial or dispositional hearing.   17 (Subd (a) lettered effective January 1, 2008; adopted as unlettered subd effective January 1, 1985.)  (b) Trial calendaring and continuances  Any request for a continuance, including a request to trail the trial date, must comply with rule 4.113 and the requirement in section 1050 to show good cause to continue a hearing in a criminal proceeding. Active management of trial calendars is necessary to minimize the number of statutory dismissals. Accordingly, courts should avoid calendaring or trailing criminal cases for trial to the last day permitted for trial under section 1382. Courts must implement calendar management procedures, in accordance with local conditions and needs, to ensure that criminal cases are assigned to trial departments before the last day permitted for trial under section 1382.    (Subd (b) adopted effective January 1, 2008.)  Rule 4.115 amended effective January 1, 2008; adopted as section 10 of the Standards of Judicial Administration effective January 1, 1985; amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.  Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivision (b) clarifies that the \u201cgood cause\u201d showing for a continuance under section 1050 applies in all criminal cases, whether or not the case is in the 10-day grace period provided for in section 1382. The Trial Court Presiding Judges Advisory Committee and Criminal Law Advisory Committee observe that the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement for a continuance is separate and distinct from the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement to avoid dismissals under section 1382. There is case law stating that the prosecution is not required to show good cause to avoid a dismissal under section 1382 during the 10-day grace period because a case may not be dismissed for delay during that 10-day period. (See, e.g., Bryant v. Superior Court (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 483, 488.) Yet, both the plain language of section 1050 and case law show that there must be good cause for a continuance under section 1050 during the 10-day grace period. (See, e.g., section 1050 and People v. Henderson  (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 922, 939\u2013940.) Thus, a court may not dismiss a case during the 10-day grace period under section 1382, but the committees believe that the court must deny a request for a continuance during the 10-day grace period that does not comply with the good cause requirement under section 1050.  The decision in Henderson  states that when the prosecutor seeks a continuance but fails to show good cause under section 1050, the trial court \u201cmust nevertheless postpone the hearing to another date within the statutory period.\u201d (115 Cal.App.4th at p. 940.) That conclusion, however, may be contrary to the plain language of section 1050, which requires a court to deny a continuance if the moving party fails to show good cause. The conclusion also appears to be dicta, as it was not a contested issue on appeal. Given this uncertainty, the rule is silent as to the remedy for failure to show good cause for a requested continuance during the 10-day grace period. The committees note that the remedies under section 1050.5 are available and, but for the Henderson  dicta, a court would appear to be allowed to deny the continuance request and commence the trial on the scheduled trial date.   18 Rule 4.116.  Certification to juvenile court  (a) Application   This rule applies to all cases not filed in juvenile court in which the person charged by an accusatory pleading appears to be under the age of 18, except when jurisdiction over the child has been transferred from the juvenile court under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707.  (Subd (a) amended effective May 22, 2017; adopted effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Procedure to determine whether certification is appropriate   If an accusatory pleading is pending, and it is suggested or it appears to the court that the person charged was under the age of 18 on the date the offense is alleged to have been committed, the court must immediately suspend proceedings and conduct a hearing to determine the true age of the person charged. The burden of proof of establishing the age of the accused person is on the moving party. If, after examination, the court is satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence that the person was under the age of 18 on the date the alleged offense was committed, the court must immediately certify the matter to the juvenile court and state on the certification order:  (1) The crime with which the person named is charged;  (2) That the person was under the age of 18 on the date of the alleged offense;  (3) The date of birth of the person;  (4) The date of suspension of criminal proceedings; and  (5) The date and time of certification to juvenile court.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as untitled subd effective January 1, 1991; previously amended and lettered effective January 1, 2001.)  (c) Procedure on certification  If the court determines that certification to the juvenile court is appropriate under (b), copies of the certification, the accusatory pleading, and any police reports must immediately be transmitted to the clerk of the juvenile court. On receipt of the documents, the clerk of the juvenile court must immediately notify the probation officer, who must immediately investigate the matter to determine whether to commence proceedings in juvenile court.   19 (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as untitled subd effective January 1, 1991; previously amended and lettered effective January 1, 2001.)  (d) Procedure if child is in custody  If the person is under the age of 18 and is in custody, the person must immediately be transported to the juvenile detention facility.  (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted as untitled subd effective January 1, 1991; previously amended and lettered effective January 1, 2001.)  Rule 4.116 amended effective May 22, 2017; adopted as rule 241.2 effective January 1, 1991; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended July 1, 1991, and January 1, 2007.  Rule 4.117.  Qualifications for appointed trial counsel in capital cases  (a) Purpose   This rule defines minimum qualifications for attorneys appointed to represent persons charged with capital offenses in the superior courts. These minimum qualifications are designed to promote adequate representation in death penalty cases and to avoid unnecessary delay and expense by assisting the trial court in appointing qualified counsel. Nothing in this rule is intended to be used as a standard by which to measure whether the defendant received effective assistance of counsel.  (b) General qualifications   In cases in which the death penalty is sought, the court must assign qualified trial counsel to represent the defendant. The attorney may be appointed only if the court, after reviewing the attorney\u2019s background, experience, and training, determines that the attorney has demonstrated the skill, knowledge, and proficiency to diligently and competently represent the defendant. An attorney is not entitled to appointment simply because he or she meets the minimum qualifications.  (c) Designation of counsel  (1) If the court appoints more than one attorney, one must be designated lead counsel and meet the qualifications stated in (d) or (f), and at least one other must be designated associate counsel and meet the qualifications stated in (e) or (f).   (2) If the court appoints only one attorney, that attorney must meet the qualifications stated in (d) or (f).  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  20  (d) Qualifications of lead counsel   To be eligible to serve as lead counsel, an attorney must:  (1) Be an active member of the State Bar of California;   (2) Be an active trial practitioner with at least 10 years\u2019 litigation experience in the field of criminal law;   (3) Have prior experience as lead counsel in either:   (A) At least 10 serious or violent felony jury trials, including at least 2 murder cases, tried to argument, verdict, or final judgment; or   (B) At least 5 serious or violent felony jury trials, including at least 3 murder cases, tried to argument, verdict, or final judgment;   \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
