Communications between courts in different California counties concerning guardianship venue  (a) Purpose of rule  This rule addresses the communications between courts concerning guardianship venue required by Probate Code section 2204(b).

(b) Substantive communications between judicial officers  Before making a venue decision on a petition for appointment of a general guardian in a guardianship proceeding described in (a), or a decision on a petition to transfer under Probate Code section 2212 filed in the proceeding before the appointment of a guardian or temporary guardian, the judicial officer responsible for the proceeding in the guardianship court must communicate with the judicial officer or officers responsible for the custody proceeding or proceedings in the family court or courts concerning which county provides the venue for the guardianship proceeding that is in the best interests of the ward or the proposed ward.  (1) If the currently responsible judicial officer in the family court or courts cannot be identified, communication must be made with the managing or supervising judicial officer of the family departments of the other court or courts, if any, or his or her designee, or with the presiding judge of the other court or courts or his or her designee.

If communications occur between some but not all involved courts, the record of these communications must be made available to those judicial officers of the courts who were not included at or before the time the judicial officer of the guardianship court communicates with them.  (3) A record must be made of all communications between judicial officers under this subdivision.
