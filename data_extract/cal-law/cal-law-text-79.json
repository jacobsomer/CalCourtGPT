{"prompt": "cases, the defendant is presumptively eligible for probation; in some cases, the defendant is presumptively ineligible; and in some cases, probation is not allowed.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Probation in cases when defendant is presumptively ineligible  If the defendant comes under a statutory provision prohibiting probation \u201cexcept in unusual cases where the interests of justice would best be served,\u201d or a substantially equivalent provision, the court should apply the criteria in (c) to evaluate whether the statutory limitation on probation is overcome; and if it is, the court should then apply the criteria in rule 4.414 to decide whether to grant probation.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective July 1, 2003, and January 1, 2007.)  (c) Factors overcoming the presumption of ineligibility  The following factors may indicate the existence of an unusual case in which probation may be granted if otherwise appropriate:  Factors relating to basis for limitation on probation:  (1) A factor or circumstance indicating that the basis for the statutory limitation on probation, although technically present, is not fully applicable to the case, including:  (A) The factor or circumstance giving rise to the limitation on probation is, in this case, substantially less serious than the circumstances typically present in other cases involving the same probation limitation, and the defendant has no recent record of committing similar crimes or crimes of violence; and  (B) The current offense is less serious than a prior felony conviction that is the cause of the limitation on probation, and the defendant has been free from incarceration and serious violation of the law for a substantial time before the current offense.  (2) Factors limiting defendant\u2019s culpability   A factor or circumstance not amounting to a defense, but reducing the defendant\u2019s culpability for the offense, including:   68 (A) The defendant participated in the crime under circumstances of great provocation, coercion, or duress not amounting to a defense, and the defendant has no recent record of committing crimes of violence;  (B) The crime was committed because of a mental condition not amounting to a defense, and there is a high likelihood that the defendant would respond favorably to mental health care and treatment that would be required as a condition of probation; and  (C) The defendant is youthful or aged, and has no significant record of prior criminal offenses.  (3) Results of risk/needs assessment   Along with all other relevant information in the case, the court may consider the results of a risk/needs assessment of the defendant, if one was performed. The weight of a risk/needs assessment is for the court to consider in its sentencing discretion.  (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.)  Rule 4.413 amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted as rule 413 effective January 1, 1991; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective July 1, 2003, and January 1, 2007.  Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivision (c)(3). Standard 4.35 of the California Standards of Judicial Administration provides courts with additional guidance on using the results of a risk/needs assessment at sentencing.   Rule 4.414.  Criteria affecting probation  Criteria affecting the decision to grant or deny probation include facts relating to the crime and facts relating to the defendant.  (a) Facts relating to the crime  Facts relating to the crime include:  (1) The nature, seriousness, and circumstances of the crime as compared to other instances of the same crime;  (2) Whether the defendant was armed with or used a weapon;  (3) The vulnerability of the victim;  69  (4) Whether the defendant inflicted physical or emotional injury;  (5) The degree of monetary loss to the victim;  (6) Whether the defendant was an active or a passive participant;  (7) Whether the crime was committed because of an unusual circumstance, such as great provocation, which is unlikely to recur;  (8) Whether the manner in which the crime was carried out demonstrated criminal sophistication or professionalism on the part of the defendant; and  (9) Whether the defendant took advantage of a position of trust or confidence to commit the crime.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007; previously amended effective January 1, 1991.)  (b) Facts relating to the defendant  Facts relating to the defendant include:  (1) Prior record of criminal conduct, whether as an adult or a juvenile, including the recency and frequency of prior crimes; and whether the prior record indicates a pattern of regular or increasingly serious criminal conduct;  (2) Prior performance and present status on probation, mandatory supervision, postrelease community supervision, or parole;  (3) Willingness to comply with the terms of probation;  (4) Ability to comply with reasonable terms of probation as indicated by the defendant\u2019s age, education, health, mental faculties, history of alcohol or other substance abuse, family background and ties, employment and military service history, and other relevant factors;  (5) The likely effect of imprisonment on the defendant and his or her dependents;  (6) The adverse collateral consequences on the defendant\u2019s life resulting from the felony conviction;  (7) Whether the defendant is remorseful; and  (8) The likelihood that if not imprisoned the defendant will be a danger to others.   70 (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2017; previously amended effective January 1, 1991, July 1, 2003, and January 1, 2007.)  (c)  Suitability for probation  In determining the suitability of the defendant for probation, the court may consider factors in aggravation and mitigation, whether or not the factors have been stipulated to by the defendant or found true beyond a reasonable doubt at trial by a jury or the judge in a court trial.  (Subd (c) adopted effective March 14, 2022.)  Rule 4.414 amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted as rule 414 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 1991, July 1, 2003, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2017  Advisory Committee Comment  The sentencing judge\u2019s discretion to grant probation is unaffected by the Uniform Determinate Sentencing Act (section 1170(a)(3)).  The decision whether to grant probation is normally based on an overall evaluation of the likelihood that the defendant will live successfully in the general community. Each criterion points to evidence that the likelihood of success is great or small. A single criterion will rarely be determinative; in most cases, the sentencing judge will have to balance favorable and unfavorable facts.  Under criteria (b)(3) and (b)(4), it is appropriate to consider the defendant\u2019s expressions of willingness to comply and his or her apparent sincerity, and whether the defendant\u2019s home and work environment and primary associates will be supportive of the defendant\u2019s efforts to comply with the terms of probation, among other factors.  Rule 4.415.  Criteria affecting the imposition of mandatory supervision  (a) Presumption  Except where the defendant is statutorily ineligible for suspension of any part of the sentence, when imposing a term of imprisonment in county jail under section 1170(h), the court must suspend execution of a concluding portion of the term to be served as a period of mandatory supervision unless the court finds, in the interests of justice, that mandatory supervision is not appropriate in a particular case. Because section 1170(h)(5)(A) establishes a statutory presumption in favor of the imposition of a period of mandatory supervision in all applicable cases, denials of a period of mandatory supervision should be limited.  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2017.)   71 (b) Criteria for denying mandatory supervision in the interests of justice  In determining that mandatory supervision is not appropriate in the interests of justice under section 1170(h)(5)(A), the court\u2019s determination must be based on factors that are specific to a particular case or defendant. Factors the court may consider include:   (1) Consideration of the balance of custody exposure available after imposition of presentence custody credits;   (2) The defendant\u2019s present status on probation, mandatory supervision, postrelease community supervision, or parole;  (3) Specific factors related to the defendant that indicate a lack of need for treatment or supervision upon release from custody; and  (4) Whether the nature, seriousness, or circumstances of the case or the defendant\u2019s past performance on supervision substantially outweigh the benefits of supervision in promoting public safety and the defendant\u2019s successful reentry into the community upon release from custody.  (c) Criteria affecting conditions and length of mandatory supervision  In exercising discretion to select the appropriate period and conditions of mandatory supervision, factors the court may consider include:   (1) Availability of appropriate community corrections programs;  (2) Victim restitution, including any conditions or period of supervision necessary to promote the collection of any court-ordered restitution;  (3) Consideration of length and conditions of supervision to promote the successful reintegration of the defendant into the community upon release from custody;  (4) Public safety, including protection of any victims and witnesses;  (5) Past performance and present status on probation, mandatory supervision, postrelease community supervision, and parole;  (6) The balance of custody exposure after imposition of presentence custody credits;  (7) Consideration of the statutory accrual of post-sentence custody credits for mandatory supervision under section 1170(h)(5)(B) and sentences served in county jail under section 4019(a)(6);  72  (8) The defendant\u2019s specific needs and risk factors identified by a risk/needs assessment, if available; and  (9) The likely effect of extended imprisonment on the defendant and any dependents.   (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2018.)  (d) Statement of reasons for denial of mandatory supervision  Notwithstanding rule 4.412(a), when a court denies a period of mandatory supervision in the interests of justice, the court must state the reasons for the denial on the record.  Rule 4.415 amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted effective January 1, 2015; previously amended effective January 1, 2017.  Advisory Committee Comment  Penal Code section 1170.3 requires the Judicial Council to adopt rules of court that prescribe criteria for the consideration of the court at the time of sentencing regarding the court\u2019s decision to \u201c[d]eny a period of mandatory supervision in the interests of justice under paragraph (5) of subdivision (h) of Section 1170 or determine the appropriate period of and conditions of mandatory supervision.\u201d  Subdivision (a). Penal Code section 1170(h)(5)(A): \u201cUnless the court finds, in the interests of justice, that it is not appropriate in a particular case, the court, when imposing a sentence pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision, shall suspend execution of a concluding portion of the term for a period selected at the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d Under People v. Borynack  (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 958, review denied, courts may not impose mandatory supervision when the defendant is statutorily ineligible for a suspension of part of the sentence.  Subdivisions (b)(3), (b)(4), and (c)(3). The Legislature has declared that \u201c[s]trategies supporting reentering offenders through practices and programs, such as standardized risk and needs assessments, transitional community housing, treatment, medical and mental health services, and employment, have been demonstrated to significantly reduce recidivism among offenders in other states.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 17.7(a).) \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
