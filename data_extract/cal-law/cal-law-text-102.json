(3) If so informed by the child at any point, each child custody recommending counselor must notify the parties, other professionals serving on the case, and then the judicial officer:  (A) About the child\u2019s desire to provide input and address the court; and   70 (B) As soon as feasible, that the child has changed their choice about addressing the court.
