{"prompt": "Court.  (Subd (d) adopted effective January 1, 2010.)  Rule 7.955 amended effective January 1, 2010; adopted effective January 1, 2003; previously amended effective January 1, 2007.  Advisory Committee Comment  This rule requires the court to approve and allow attorney\u2019s fees in an amount that is reasonable under all the facts and circumstances, under Probate Code section 3601. The rule is declaratory of existing law concerning attorney\u2019s fees under a contingency fee agreement when the fees must be approved by the court. The facts and circumstances that the court may consider are discussed in a large body of decisional law under section 3601 and under other statutes that require the court to determine reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. The factors listed in rule 7.955(b) are modeled in part after those provided in rule 1.5 of the Rules of Professional Conduct of the State Bar of California concerning an unconscionable attorney\u2019s fee, but the advisory committee does not intend to suggest or imply that an attorney\u2019s fee must be found to be unconscionable under rule 1.5 to be determined to be unreasonable under this rule.   The rule permits, but does not require, the court to allow attorney\u2019s fees in an amount specified in a contingency fee agreement. The amount of attorney\u2019s fees allowed by the court must meet the reasonableness standard of section 3601 no matter how they are determined.    Chapter 21.  Guardianships  Rule 7.1001.
