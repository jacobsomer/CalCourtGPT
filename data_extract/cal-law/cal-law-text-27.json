{"prompt": "provision to other agencies;   (C) The requested electronic format is customary or standard for records of a similar type and is commercially available to private entity requesters; and   (D) The disclosure does not jeopardize or compromise the security or integrity of the original record or the computer software on which the original record is maintained.  (2) In addition to other fees imposed under this rule, the requester will bear the direct cost of producing a record if:  (A) In order to comply with (1), the judicial branch entity would be required to produce a record and the record is one that is produced only at otherwise regularly scheduled intervals or;  (B) Producing the requested record would require data compilation or extraction or any associated programming that the judicial branch entity is not required to perform under this rule but has agreed to perform in response to the request.   (3) Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to require a judicial branch entity to reconstruct a record in an electronic format if the judicial branch entity no longer has the record available in an electronic format.  (j) Public access disputes  (1) Unless the petitioner elects to proceed under (2) below, disputes and appeals of decisions with respect to disputes with the Judicial Council or a superior  163 court regarding access to budget and management information required to be maintained under rule 10.501 are subject to the process described in rule 10.803.  (2) Any person may institute proceedings for injunctive or declarative relief or writ of mandate in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce his or her right to inspect or to receive a copy of any judicial administrative record under this rule.   (3) Whenever it is made to appear by verified petition that a judicial administrative record is being improperly withheld from disclosure, the court with jurisdiction will order the judicial branch entity to disclose the records or show cause why it should not do so. The court will decide the case after examining the record (in camera if appropriate), papers filed by the parties, and any oral argument and additional evidence as the court may allow.  (4) If the court finds that the judicial branch entity\u2019s decision to refuse disclosure is not justified under this rule, the court will order the judicial branch entity to make the record public. If the court finds that the judicial branch entity\u2019s decision was justified, the court will issue an order supporting the decision.  (5) An order of the court, either directing disclosure or supporting the decision of the judicial branch entity refusing disclosure, is not a final judgment or order within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1 from which an appeal may be taken, but will be immediately reviewable by petition to the appellate court for the issuance of an extraordinary writ. Upon entry of an order under this subdivision, a party must, in order to obtain review of the order, file a petition within 20 days after service of a written notice of entry of the order or within such further time not exceeding an additional 20 days as the court may for good cause allow. If the notice is served by mail, the period within which to file the petition will be extended by 5 days. A stay of an order or judgment will not be granted unless the petitioning party demonstrates it will otherwise sustain irreparable damage and probable success on the merits. Any person who fails to obey the order of the court will be cited to show cause why that is not in contempt of court.  (6) The court will award court costs and reasonable attorney fees to the plaintiff should the plaintiff prevail in litigation filed under this subdivision. The costs and fees will be paid by the judicial branch entity and will not become a personal liability of any individual. If the court finds that the plaintiff\u2019s case is clearly frivolous, it will award court costs and reasonable attorney fees to the judicial branch entity.  (Subd (j) amended effective January 1, 2016.)  Rule 10.500 amended effective January 1, 2016; adopted effective January 1, 2010.   164 Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivision (a).  By establishing a public access rule applicable to all judicial administrative records, the proposed rule would expand public access to these records. The Judicial Council recognizes the important public interest in access to records and information relating to the administration of the judicial branch. The Judicial Council also recognizes the importance of the privacy rights of individuals working in or doing business with judicial branch entities and the public\u2019s interest in an effective and independent judicial branch of state government. The report on this rule includes the Judicial Council\u2019s findings on the impact of this rule on these interests, and how these interests are protected by the rule.   Subdivisions (b)(1) and (b)(2).  This rule does not apply to adjudicative records, and is not intended to modify existing law regarding public access to adjudicative records. California case law has established that, in general, subject to specific statutory exceptions, case records that accurately and officially reflect the work of the court are public records open to inspection. (Estate of Hearst (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 777, 782-83. ) However, documents prepared in the course of adjudicative work and not regarded as official case records, such as preliminary drafts, personal notes, and rough records of proceedings, are not subject to public access because the perceived harm to the judicial process by requiring this material to be available to the public is greater than the benefit the public might derive from its disclosure. ( Copley Press, Inc. v. Superior Court (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 106.)   Subdivision (c)(2).  The application of this rule is intended to reflect existing case law under the California Public Records Act that exempts from the definition of \u201cpublic record\u201d certain types of personal records and information. The concept was first discussed in the California Assembly and establishes that if personal correspondence and information are \u201cunrelated to the conduct of the people\u2019s business\u201d they are therefore not public records. ( San Gabriel Tribune v. Superior Court (1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 762, 774, citing Assembly Committee on Statewide Information Policy California Public Records Act of 1968, section B, page 9, Appendix to Assembly Journal (1970 Reg. Sess.).) Case law has further established that only records necessary or convenient to the discharge of official duty, or kept as necessary or convenient to the discharge of official duty, are public records for the purposes of the California Public Records Act and its predecessors. ( Braun v. City of Taft (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 332 ; City Council of Santa Monica v. Superior Court  (1962) 204 Cal.App.2d 68.)  Subdivision (e)(4).  The fees charged by a judicial branch entity under this rule are intended to allow the entity to recover an amount not to exceed the reasonable costs of responding to a request for records or information. In accordance with existing practice within the judicial branch and the other branches of government, the Judicial Council intends agencies and entities of the executive and legislative branches of the California state government to receive records or information requested from judicial branch entities for the agency\u2019s or entity\u2019s use free of charge. This subdivision is intended to provide, however, that requesters of records or information for the purpose of furthering the requester\u2019s commercial interests will be charged for costs incurred by the judicial branch entity in responding to the request, and that such costs will not be a charge against the budget of the judicial branch of the state General Fund.   Subdivision (f)(3).  In addition to the types of records and information exempt from disclosure under the corresponding provision of the California Public Records Act, Government Code section 6254(c), this provision includes a further nonexclusive list of specific information that is exempt under this rule. The rule does not attempt to list each category of information that is  165 specific to judicial branch entities and that may also be exempt under this rule. For example, although they are not specifically listed, this provision exempts from disclosure records maintained by any court or court-appointed counsel administrator for the purpose of evaluating attorneys seeking or being considered for appointment to cases.  Subdivision (f)(10).  The definition of \u201ctrade secret\u201d restates the definition in Civil Code section 3426.1.   Subdivision (f)(11). This subdivision is intended to reflect California law on the subject of the \u201cdeliberative process\u201d exemption under the California Public Records Act, which is currently stated in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court  (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325 and the later Court of Appeal decisions California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 159 and Wilson v. Superior Court  (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 1136.  Subdivision (j)(1). Under current rule 10.803 a petitioner may file a writ in a superior court regarding a dispute with a superior court or the Judicial Council with respect to disclosure of records and information required to be maintained under current rule 10.802. The writ petition must be heard on an expedited basis and includes a right to an appeal. The statutory authority for the hearing process set forth in current rule 10.803, Government Code section 71675(b), does not extend this procedure to other disputes with respect to public access. The rule provides that petitioners with a dispute with any other judicial branch entity, or with respect to records that are not required to be maintained under rule 10.802, may follow the procedure set forth in (j)(2) through (j)(6), which is equivalent to the dispute resolution procedure of the California Public Records Act. A petitioner eligible for the dispute resolution process set out in current rule 10.803 may also elect to proceed with his or her dispute under the procedure set forth in (j)(2) through (j)(6).   Rule 10.501.  Maintenance of budget and management information  (a) Maintenance of information by the superior court   Each superior court must maintain for a period of three years from the close of the fiscal year to which the following relate:   (1) Official documents of the superior court pertaining to the approved superior court budget allocation adopted by the Judicial Council and actual final year-end superior court revenue and expenditure reports as required in budget procedures issued by Judicial Council staff to be maintained or reported to the council, including budget allocation, revenue, and expenditure reports;  (2) Records or other factual management information on matters that are within the scope of representation as defined in Government Code section 71634 unless distribution is otherwise precluded by law; and  (3) Records or other factual management information on other matters referred to in Government Code section 71634 unless distribution is otherwise precluded by law.   166 (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2016.)  (b) Maintenance of information by Judicial Council staff  Judicial Council staff must maintain for a period of three years from the close of the fiscal year to which the following relate:  (1) Official approved budget allocations for each superior court;   \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
