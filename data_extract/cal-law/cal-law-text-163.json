(Subd (f) amended effective January 1, 2014.)  Rule 5.651 amended effective January 1, 2014; adopted effective January 1, 2008.  Advisory Committee Comment  A child or youth in, or at risk of entering, foster care has a statutory right to a meaningful opportunity to meet the state\u2019s academic achievement standards. To protect this right, the juvenile court, advocates, placing agencies, care providers, educators, and service providers must work together to maintain stable school placements and ensure that the child or youth is placed in the least restrictive educational programs and has access to the academic resources, services, and extracurricular and enrichment activities that are available to other pupils. This rule, sections 362 and 727, and rule 5.575 provide procedures for coordinating the provision of services to ensure that the child\u2019s or youth\u2019s educational and developmental-services needs are met.  Congress has found that improving the educational performance of children with disabilities is an essential prerequisite to ensuring their equality of opportunity, full participation in education, and economic self-sufficiency. Children and youth in foster care are disproportionately represented in the population of pupils with disabilities and face systemic challenges to attaining self-sufficiency. Children and youth in foster care have rights arising out of federal and state law, including the IDEA, the ADA, and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. To comply with federal requirements regarding the identification of children and youth with disabilities and the provision of services to those children and youth who qualify, the court, parent or guardian, placing agency, attorneys, CASA volunteer, local educational agencies, and educational rights holders must affirmatively address the child\u2019s or youth\u2019s educational and developmental-services needs. The court must continually inquire about the educational and developmental-services needs of the child or youth and the progress being made to enforce any rights the child or youth has under these laws.  Rule 5.652.  Access to pupil records for truancy purposes  (a) Conditions of access (Ed. Code, \u00a7 49076)  Education Code section 49076 authorizes a school district to permit access to pupil records, including accurate copies, to any judicial officer or probation officer without consent of the pupil\u2019s parent or guardian and without a court order for the purposes of:  (1) Conducting a truancy mediation program for the pupil; or  438  (2) Presenting evidence in a truancy proceeding under section 681(b).  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (b) Written certification  The judicial officer or probation officer may request pupil records but must certify in writing that the requested information will be used only for purposes of truancy mediation or a truancy petition. A judicial officer or probation officer must complete and file Certified Request for Pupil Records\u2014Truancy (form JV-530) and serve it with Local Educational Agency Response to JV-530 (form JV-531), by first-class mail to the local educational agency.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (c) Local educational agency response  Form JV-531 must be completed by the local educational agency and returned to the requesting judicial officer or probation officer within 15 calendar days of receipt of the request with copies of any responsive pupil records attached. After receipt the judicial officer or probation officer must file form JV-531 and the attached pupil records in the truancy proceedings.  (1) The school district must inform by telephone or other means, or provide written notification to, the child\u2019s parent or guardian within 24 hours of the release of the information.  (2) If a parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s educational rights have been terminated, the school must notify the child\u2019s surrogate parent, relative, or other individual responsible for the child\u2019s education.
