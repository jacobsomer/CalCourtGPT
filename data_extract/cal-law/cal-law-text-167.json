{"prompt": "request withdrawal from appointment due to a purported conflict of interest.  Nothing in this rule is intended to extend the permissible scope of any judicial inquiry into an attorney\u2019s reasons for declining to represent one or more siblings or requesting to withdraw from representation of one or more siblings, due to an actual or reasonably likely conflict of interest. (See State Bar Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 3-310(C).) While the court has the duty and authority to inquire as to the general nature of an asserted conflict of interest, it cannot require an attorney to disclose any privileged communication, even if such information forms the basis of the alleged conflict. ( In re James S.  (1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 930, 934; Aceves v. Superior Court (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 584, 592\u2013593.)  Rule 5.661.

(b) Child as appellant  A notice of appeal on behalf of the child must be filed by the child\u2019s trial counsel, guardian ad litem, or the child if the child is seeking appellate relief from the trial court\u2019s judgment or order.  (c) Recommendation from child\u2019s trial counsel or guardian ad litem  (1) In any juvenile dependency proceeding in which a party other than the child files a notice of appeal, if the child\u2019s trial counsel or guardian ad litem concludes that, for purposes of the appeal, the child\u2019s best interests cannot be protected without the appointment of separate counsel on appeal, the child\u2019s trial counsel or guardian ad litem must file a recommendation in the Court of Appeal requesting appointment of separate counsel.  (2) A child\u2019s trial counsel or guardian ad litem who recommends appointment of appellate counsel for a child who is not an appellant must follow the procedures outlined in (d)\u2013(g).   458 (d) Time for trial counsel or guardian ad litem to file the recommendation with the Court of Appeal  A recommendation from the child\u2019s trial counsel or guardian ad litem may be filed at any time after a notice of appeal has been filed, but absent good cause, must be filed in the Court of Appeal no later than 20 calendar days after the filing of the last appellant\u2019s opening brief.  (e) Service of recommendation  The child\u2019s trial counsel or guardian ad litem must serve a copy of the recommendation filed in the Court of Appeal on the district appellate project and the trial court.  (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2015.)  (f) Factors to be considered  The following are factors to be considered by a child\u2019s trial counsel or guardian ad litem in making a recommendation to the Court of Appeal:  (1) An actual or potential conflict exists between the interests of the child and the interests of any respondent;  (2) The child did not have an attorney serving as his or her guardian ad litem in the trial court;  (3) The child is of a sufficient age or development such that he or she is able to understand the nature of the proceedings; and  (A) The child expresses a desire to participate in the appeal; or  (B) The child\u2019s wishes differ from his or her trial counsel\u2019s position;  (4) The child took a legal position in the trial court adverse to that of one of his or her siblings, and an issue has been raised in an appellant\u2019s opening brief regarding the siblings\u2019 adverse positions;  (5) The appeal involves a legal issue regarding a determination of parentage, the child\u2019s inheritance rights, educational rights, privileges identified in division 8 of the Evidence Code, consent to treatment, or tribal membership;   459 (6) Postjudgment evidence completely undermines the legal underpinnings of the juvenile court\u2019s judgment under review, and all parties recognize this and express a willingness to stipulate to reversal of the juvenile court\u2019s judgment;  (7) The child\u2019s trial counsel or guardian ad litem, after reviewing the appellate briefs, believes that the legal arguments contained in the respondents\u2019 briefs do not adequately represent or protect the best interests of the child; and  (8) The existence of any other factors relevant to the child\u2019s best interests.  (g) Form of recommendation  The child\u2019s trial counsel, the guardian ad litem, or the child may use Recommendation for Appointment of Appellate Attorney for Child (form JV-810). Any recommendation for an appellate attorney for the child must state a factual basis for the recommendation, include the information provided on form JV-810, and be signed under penalty of perjury.
