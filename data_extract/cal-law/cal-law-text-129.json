Rule 5.490 adopted effective July 1, 2013.  Advisory Committee Comment  The Hague Adoption Convention (HAC) is a treaty that entered into force with respect to the United States on April 1, 2008. The HAC strengthens protections for children, birth parents, and prospective adoptive parents and establishes internationally agreed-upon rules and procedures for adoptions between countries that have a treaty relationship under the HAC. It provides a framework for countries party to the Convention to work together to ensure that children are provided with permanent, loving homes; that adoptions take place in the best interest of a child; and that the abduction, sale, or traffic of children is prevented. This rule expands procedurally on Family Code sections 8900 through 8925, which address intercountry adoptions, by specifying the findings and evidence set forth in 22 Code of Federal Regulations section 97.3 that are required by a state court when the HAC applies to an adoption.  Rule 5.491.  Adoption of a child resident in the United States by a resident of a foreign country not party to the Hague Adoption Convention  The adoption of a child resident in the United States by a resident of a foreign country not party to the Hague Adoption Convention must conform to the law governing California adoptions.  Rule 5.491 adopted effective July 1, 2013.  Rule 5.492.  Adoption by a United States resident of a child resident in a foreign country that is party to the Hague Adoption Convention  A United States resident who plans to adopt, in California, a child resident in a foreign country that is party to the Hague Adoption Convention must provide to the California  242 court the required proof, in the form of a Hague Custody Declaration, that all required \n where is the above file from?", "completion": "The above text is from The California Rules of Court Current as of January 1, 2022."}
