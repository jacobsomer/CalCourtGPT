{"prompt": " (Subd (d) amended effective January 1, 2007.)  (e) Disputed facts  In the event the parties dispute the facts on which the conviction rested, the court must conduct a presentence hearing and make appropriate corrections, additions, or deletions in the presentence probation report or order a revised report.  (Subd (e) amended effective January 1, 2007; adopted effective January 1, 1991.)  Rule 4.437 amended effective May 23, 2007; adopted as rule 437 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective July 28, 1977, January 1, 1991, and January 1, 2007.   93 Advisory Committee Comment  Section 1170(b)(4) states in part:  \u201cAt least four days prior to the time set for imposition of judgment, either party or the victim, or the family of the victim if the victim is deceased, may submit a statement in aggravation or mitigation to dispute facts in the record or the probation officer\u2019s report, or to present additional facts.\u201d  This provision means that the statement is a document giving notice of intention to dispute evidence in the record or the probation officer\u2019s report, or to present additional facts.  The statement itself cannot be the medium for presenting new evidence, or for rebutting competent evidence already presented, because the statement is a unilateral presentation by one party or counsel that will not necessarily have any indicia of reliability. To allow its factual assertions to be considered in the absence of corroborating evidence would, therefore, constitute a denial of due process of law in violation of the United States (14th Amend.) and California (art. I, \u00a7 7) Constitutions.  The requirement that the statement include notice of intention to rely on new evidence will enhance fairness to both sides by avoiding surprise and helping to ensure that the time limit on pronouncing sentence is met. This notice may include either party\u2019s intention to provide evidence to prove or contest the existence of a factor in mitigation that would require imposition of the low term for the underlying offense or dismissal of an enhancement.   Rule 4.447. Sentencing of enhancements  (a) Enhancements resulting in unlawful sentences  Except pursuant to section 1385(c), a court may not strike or dismiss an enhancement solely because imposition of the term is prohibited by law or exceeds limitations on the imposition of multiple enhancements. Instead, the court must:  (1) Impose a sentence for the aggregate term of imprisonment computed without reference to those prohibitions or limitations; and  (2) Stay execution of the part of the term that is prohibited or exceeds the applicable limitation. The stay will become permanent once the defendant finishes serving the part of the sentence that has not been stayed.  (Subd (a) amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted effective January 1, 2018.)  (b) Multiple enhancements  Notwithstanding section 1385(c), if a defendant is convicted of multiple enhancements of the same type, the court must either sentence each enhancement or, if authorized, strike the enhancement or its punishment. While the court may  94 strike an enhancement, the court may not stay an enhancement except as provided in (a) or as authorized by section 654.  (Subd (b) amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted effective January 1, 2018.)  Rule 4.447 amended effective March 14, 2022; adopted as rule 447 effective July 1, 1977; previously amended and renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective July 28, 1977, January 1, 1991, July 1, 2003, January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2018.   Advisory Committee Comment   Subdivision (a). Statutory restrictions may prohibit or limit the imposition of an enhancement in certain situations. (See, for example, sections 186.22(b)(1), 667(a)(2), 667.61(f), 1170.1(f) and (g), 12022.53(e)(2) and (f), and Vehicle Code section 23558.)  Section 1385(c) requires that in the furtherance of justice certain enhancements be dismissed unless dismissal is prohibited by any initiative statute.    Present practice of staying execution is followed to avoid violating a statutory prohibition or exceeding a statutory limitation, while preserving the possibility of imposition of the stayed portion should a reversal on appeal reduce the unstayed portion of the sentence. (See People v. Gonzalez (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1118, 1129\u20131130; People v. Niles (1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 749, 756.)  Only the portion of a sentence or component thereof that exceeds a limitation is prohibited, and this rule provides a procedure for that situation. This rule applies to both determinate and indeterminate terms.  Subdivision (b). A court may stay an enhancement if section 654 applies. (See People v. Bradley (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 386; People v. Haykel (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 146, 152.)  Rule 4.451. Sentence consecutive to or concurrent with indeterminate term or term in other jurisdiction  (a) When a defendant is sentenced under section 1170 and the sentence is to run consecutively to or concurrently with a sentence imposed under section 1168(b) in the same or another proceeding, the judgment must specify the determinate term imposed under section 1170 computed without reference to the indeterminate sentence, must order that the determinate term be served consecutively to or concurrently with the sentence under section 1168(b), and must identify the proceedings in which the indeterminate sentence was imposed. The term under section 1168(b), and the date of its completion or date of parole or postrelease community supervision, and the sequence in which the sentences are deemed or served, will be determined by correctional authorities as provided by law.   Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended effective January 1, 1979, July 1, 2003, and January 1. 2007.)   95 (b) When a defendant is sentenced under sections 1168 or 1170 and the sentence is to run consecutively to or concurrently with a sentence imposed by a court of the United States or of another state or territory, the judgment must specify the term imposed under sections 1168(b) or 1170 computed without reference to the sentence imposed by the other jurisdiction, must identify the other jurisdiction and the proceedings in which the other sentence was imposed, and must indicate whether the sentences are imposed concurrently or consecutively. If the term imposed is to be served consecutively to the term imposed by the other jurisdiction, the court must order that the California term be served commencing on the completion of the sentence imposed by the other jurisdiction.  (Subd (b) amended effective January 1, 2018; previously amended January 1, 2007.)  Rule 4.451 amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted as rule 451 effective July 1, 1977; previously renumbered effective January 1, 2001; previously amended effective January 1, 1979, July 1, 2003, and January 1, 2007.  Advisory Committee Comment   Subdivision (a).  The provisions of section 1170.1(a), which use a one-third formula to calculate subordinate consecutive terms, can logically be applied only when all the sentences are imposed under section 1170. Indeterminate sentences are imposed under section 1168(b). Since the duration of the indeterminate term cannot be known to the court, subdivision (a) states the only feasible mode of sentencing. (See People v. Felix (2000) 22 Cal.4th 651, 654\u2013657; People v. McGahuey  (1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 524, 530\u2013532.)  Subdivision (b).  On the authority to sentence consecutively to the sentence of another jurisdiction and the effect of such a sentence, see In re Helpman (1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 307 and cases cited at page 310, footnote 3. The mode of sentencing required by subdivision (b) is necessary to avoid the illogical conclusion that the total of the consecutive sentences will depend on whether the other jurisdiction or California is the first to pronounce judgment.   Rule 4.452.  Determinate sentence consecutive to prior determinate sentence  (a) If a determinate sentence is imposed under section 1170.1(a) consecutive to one or more determinate sentences imposed previously in the same court or in other courts, the court in the current case must pronounce a single aggregate term, as defined in section 1170.1(a), stating the result of combining the previous and current sentences. In those situations:   (1) The sentences on all determinately sentenced counts in all the cases on which a sentence was or is being imposed must be combined as though they were all counts in the current case.  (2) The court in the current case must make a new determination of which count, in the combined cases, represents the principal term, as defined in section 1170.1(a). The principal term is the term with the greatest punishment  96 imposed including conduct enhancements. If two terms of imprisonment have the same punishment, either term may be selected as the principal term.  (3) Discretionary decisions of courts in previous cases may not be changed by the court in the current case. Such decisions include the decision to impose one of the three authorized terms of imprisonment referred to in section 1170(b), making counts in prior cases concurrent with or consecutive to each other, or the decision that circumstances in mitigation or in the furtherance of justice justified striking the punishment for an enhancement. However, if a previously designated principal term becomes a subordinate term after the resentencing, the subordinate term will be limited to one-third the middle base term as provided in section 1170.1(a).  (4) If all previously imposed sentences and the current sentence being imposed by the second or subsequent court are under section 1170(h), the second or subsequent court has the discretion to specify whether a previous sentence is to be served in custody or on mandatory supervision and the terms of such supervision, but may not, without express consent of the defendant, modify the sentence on the earlier sentenced charges in any manner that will (i) increase the total length of the sentence imposed by the previous court; (ii) increase the total length of the custody portion of the sentence imposed by the previous court; (iii) increase the total length of the mandatory supervision portion of the sentence imposed by the previous court; or (iv) impose additional, more onerous, or more restrictive conditions of release for any previously imposed period of mandatory supervision.  (5) If the second or subsequent court imposes a sentence to state prison because the defendant is ineligible for sentencing under section 1170(h), the jurisdiction of the second or subsequent court to impose a prison sentence applies solely to the current case. The defendant must be returned to the original sentencing court for potential resentencing on any previous case or cases sentenced under section 1170(h). The original sentencing court must convert all remaining custody and mandatory supervision time imposed in the previous case to state prison custody time and must determine whether its sentence is concurrent with or consecutive to the state prison term imposed by the second or subsequent court and incorporate that sentence into a single aggregate term as required by this rule. (A)(4) does not apply\u2014and the consent of the defendant is not required\u2014for this conversion and resentencing.  (6) In cases in which a sentence is imposed under the provisions of section 1170(h) and the sentence has been imposed by courts in two or more counties, the second or subsequent court must determine the county or counties of incarceration or supervision, including the order of service of such incarceration or supervision.
