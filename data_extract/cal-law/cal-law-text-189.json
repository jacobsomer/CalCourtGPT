{"prompt": "probation department has established by a preponderance of evidence that return would create a substantial risk of detriment to the safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the ward. The probation department has the burden of establishing that detriment. In making its determination, the court must review and consider all reports submitted to the court and must consider the efforts and progress demonstrated by the child and the family and the extent to which the child availed himself or herself of the services provided.  (3) Findings and orders (\u00a7 727.2(e))   The court must consider the safety of the ward and make findings and orders that determine the following:  (A) The continuing necessity for and appropriateness of the placement;  (B) The extent of the probation department\u2019s compliance with the case plan in making reasonable efforts to safely return the child to the child \u2019s home and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child;   584 (C) Whether it is necessary to limit the rights of the parent or guardian to make educational or developmental-services decisions for the child. If the court limits those rights or, if the ward is 18 years of age or older and has chosen not to make educational or developmental-services decisions for him- or herself or has been deemed incompetent, finds that it is in the best interests of the ward, the court must appoint a responsible adult as the educational rights holder as defined in rule 5.502.

If the court finds that the child was not appropriately involved, the court must order the probation department to actively involve the child in the development of his or her own case plan and plan for permanent placement, unless the court finds that the child is unable, unavailable, or unwilling to participate;  (H) Whether each parent was actively involved in the development of the case plan and plan for permanent placement. If the court finds that any parent was not actively involved, the court must order the probation department to actively involve that parent in the development of the case plan and plan for permanent placement, unless the court finds that the parent is unable, unavailable, or unwilling to participate; and  (I) If sibling interaction has been suspended and will continue to be suspended, that sibling interaction is contrary to the safety or well-being of either child.   585 (4) Basis for Findings and Orders (\u00a7 727.2(e))   The determinations required by (a)(3) must be made on a case-by-case basis, and the court must reference, in its written findings, the probation officer\u2019s report and any other evidence relied on in reaching its decision.
