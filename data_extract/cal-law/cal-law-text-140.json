To promote caregiver participation and input, judicial officers are encouraged to permit caregivers to orally address the court when caregivers would like to share information about the child. In addition, court clerks should allow filings by caregivers even if the caregiver has not strictly adhered to the requirements in the rule regarding number of copies and filing deadlines.
