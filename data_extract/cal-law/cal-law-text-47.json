Rule 10.1028.  Preservation and destruction of Court of Appeal records  (a) Form or forms in which records may be preserved  (1) Court of Appeal records may be created, maintained, and preserved in any form or forms of communication or representation, including paper or optical, electronic, magnetic, micrographic, or photographic media or other technology, if the form or forms of representation or communication satisfy the standards or guidelines for the creation, maintenance, reproduction, and preservation of court records established under rule 10.854.  (2) If records are preserved in a medium other than paper, the following provisions of Government Code section 68150 apply: subdivisions (c)\u2013( l), excluding subdivision (i)(1).  (Subd (a) amended effective January 1, 2013.)  (b) Methods for signing, subscribing, or verifying documents  Any notice, order, ruling, decision, opinion, memorandum, certificate of service, or similar document issued by an appellate court or by a judicial officer of an appellate court may be signed, subscribed, or verified using a computer or other technology in accordance with procedures, standards, and guidelines established by the Judicial Council. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all notices, orders, rulings, decisions, opinions, memoranda, certificates of service, or similar documents that are signed, subscribed, or verified by computer or other technological means under this subdivision shall have the same validity, and the same legal force and effect, as paper documents signed, subscribed, or verified by an appellate court or a judicial officer of the court.  (Subd (b) adopted effective January 1, 2013.)  (c) Permanent records  The clerk/executive officer of the Court of Appeal must permanently keep the court\u2019s minutes and a register of appeals and original proceedings.   281 (Subd (c) amended effective January 1, 2018; adopted as subd (b); previously relettered effective January 1, 2013.)  (d) Time to keep other records  (1) Except as provided in (2) and (3), the clerk/executive officer may destroy all other records in a case 10 years after the decision becomes final, as ordered by the administrative presiding justice or, in a court with only one division, by the presiding justice.

(3) In a felony case in which the court affirms a judgment of conviction in whole or in part, the clerk/executive officer must keep the original reporter\u2019s transcript or, if the original is in paper, either the original or a true and correct electronic copy of the transcript, for 75 years after the decision becomes final.

Advisory Committee Comment  Subdivision (d).  Subdivision (d) permits the Court of Appeal to keep an electronic copy of the reporter\u2019s transcript in lieu of keeping the original if the original transcript is in paper. Although subdivision (a) allows the Court of Appeal to maintain its records in any form that satisfies the otherwise applicable standards for maintenance of court records, including electronic forms, Code of Civil Procedure section 271 provides that an original reporter\u2019s transcript must be in electronic form unless a specified exception allows for an original paper transcript. Subdivision (d) therefore specifies that an electronic copy may be kept if the original transcript is in paper, to clarify that the paper original need not be kept by the court.  Rule 10.1030.  Local rules of Courts of Appeal  (a) Publication  (1) A Court of Appeal must submit any local rule it adopts to the Reporter of Decisions for publication in the advance pamphlets of the Official Reports.   282 (2) As used in this rule, \u201cpublication\u201d means printing in the manner in which amendments to the California Rules of Court are printed.
